homarus gammarus , known as the european lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean , mediterranean sea and parts of the black sea .
it is closely related to the american lobster , h. americanus .
it may grow to a length of CD cm CD in and a mass of CD kilograms CD lb , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws .
in life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming lobster red on cooking .
mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae .
homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the british isles .
like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must she would in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis moulting .
this may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every CD CD years for larger animals .
the first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws .
the larger one is the crusher , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey .
the other is the cutter , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey .
usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter .
the exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below .
the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking .
this occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment .
the closest relative of h. gammarus is the american lobster , homarus americanus .
the CD species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap .
the CD species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics
the rostrum of h. americanus bears CD or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in h. gammarus .
the spines on the claws of h. americanus are red or red tipped , while those of h. gammarus are white or white tipped .
the underside of the claw of h. americanus is orange or red , while that of h. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .
female h. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of CD CD millimetres CD CD CD CD in , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size .
mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose she will is therefore soft , and a hard shelled male .
the female carries the eggs for up to CD months , depending on the temperature , attached to her pleopods .
females carrying eggs are said to be berried and can be found throughout the year .
the eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on zooplankton .
this stage involves CD moults and lasts for CD CD days .
after the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle .
the juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows .
it is estimated that only CD larva in every CD CD survives to the benthic phase .
when they reach a carapace length of CD CD CD CD in , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives .
homarus gammarus is found across the north eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco , not including the baltic sea .
it is also present in most of the mediterranean sea , only missing from the section east of crete , and along only the north west coast of the black sea .
the northernmost populations are found in the norwegian fjords tysfjorden and nordfolda , inside the arctic circle .
the species can be divided into CD genetically distinct populations , CD widespread population , and CD which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment .
the first of these is the population of lobsters from northern norway , which have been referred to as the midnight sun lobster .
the populations in the mediterranean sea are distinct from those in the atlantic ocean .
the last distinct population is found in the netherlands samples from the oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the north sea or english channel .
attempts have been made to introduce h. gammarus to new zealand , alongside other european species such as the edible crab , cancer pagurus .
between CD and CD , CD CD lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in dunedin , but the species did not become established there .
adult h. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of CD CD metres CD CD ft , although not normally deeper than CD m CD ft .
they prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed .
the diet of h. gammarus mostly consists of other benthic invertebrates .
these include crabs , molluscs , sea urchins , starfish and polychaete worms .
the CD clawed lobster species homarus gammarus , h. americanus and nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the CD known species of the animal phylum cycliophora .
the species on h. gammarus has not been described .
homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia , caused by the bacterium aerococcus viridans .
although it is frequently found in american lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive h. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by h. americanus could not be ruled out .
homarus gammarus is traditionally highly esteemed as a foodstuff and was mentioned in the crabfish a seventeenth century english folk song .
it may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered .
both the claws and the abdomen of h. gammarus contain excellent white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible .
the exceptions are the gastric mill and the sand vein gut .
the price of h. gammarus is up to CD times higher than that of h. americanus , and the european species is considered to have a better flavour .
lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand .
in CD , CD CD t of h. gammarus were caught across europe and north africa , of which CD CD t CD was caught in the british isles including the channel islands .
the minimum landing size for h. gammarus is a carapace length of CD CD CD CD in .
aquaculture systems for h. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low .
homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus in the tenth edition of his systema naturae , published in CD .
that name was cancer gammarus , since linnaeus concept of the genus cancer at that time included all large crustaceans .
h. gammarus is the type species of the genus homarus weber , CD , as determined by direction CD of the international commission on zoological nomenclature .
the type specimen of homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by lipke holthuis in CD .
it came from CD CD CD CD CD e , near marstrand , sweden CD kilometres or CD miles northwest of gothenburg , but both it and the paralectotypes have since been lost .

m 82 is a state trunkline in the lower peninsula in the us state of michigan that travels between fremont and howard city .
the section between newaygo and howard city travels through fremont and along the southern edge of manistee national forest .
the current version of m 82 is actually the second in the state .
the first usage appeared in the upper peninsula by CD .
the lower peninsula routing has been in use since the CD .
various extensions and truncations have shifted the terminus as far west as new era or hesperia in the past .
the current route was finalized in the late 1970s
m 82 begins at a junction with m CD and b CD west of fremont .
this junction is at a tripoint of county lines .
m CD forms the north south newaygo oceana and newaygo muskegon county lines .
b CD , which forms the east west oceana muskegon county line runs due west of the intersection .
m 82 exits the intersection to the east .
the highway runs along 48th street through rural farms into the community of fremont .
the road , now called main street , passes through the downtown area and m 82 turns south along stewart avenue out of town .
the highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd street running eastward through more farm land .
as the trunkline approaches newaygo , the terrain becomes more wooded near the muskegon river .
m 82 follows fremont street east to a junction with m CD .
the CD highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on state street .
south of downtown , m 82 turns east again , independent of m CD , and runs along 82nd street on the southern edge of the manistee national forest .
the east end of m 82 is at exit CD on us CD m CD west of howard city .
the michigan department of transportation mdot , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways .
these levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic aadt , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year .
in CD , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of m CD west of fremont had the peak volume for the highway at CD CD vehicles daily .
the traffic nadir was CD CD vehicles east of newaygo .
in addition , mdot has not had any section of the highway listed on the national highway system , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .
the first usage of m 82 was in the upper peninsula by july CD , CD .
the trunkline started at m CD and ran north of newberry to the vicinity of eight mile corner .
it was later replaced by m CD in CD .
the current m 82 dates back to CD .
it ran from us CD in hart to the northern junction of us CD and m CD in howard city .
the highway was routed through ferry , hesperia and fremont , replacing m CD .
in late CD , m CD was extended along the section between newaygo and howard city , forming a m CD m 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the m CD routing .
this concurrent section became just m CD in CD , shortening m CD back to the northern m CD junction in newaygo .
the highway was moved to a new alignment west of ferry in late CD or early CD .
instead of heading northwesterly to hart , it was continued west to end in shelby .
CD realignments in CD and CD rerouted the western end of the highway again .
this time it was realigned to run from hesperia to new era , bypassing ferry .
a larger change around CD reconfigured the highway designations in oceana county .
m CD replaced m CD west of hesperia , to end at new era instead of muskegon .
the new m CD designation replaced m CD south of hesperia .
m 82 now ran from hesperia to newaygo only .
the length of the highway was increased in CD when the eastern end was moved back to howard city .
m CD was rerouted to follow the us CD freeway south of howard city to cedar springs , and replaced m CD between cedar springs and casnovia .
this freed up the newaygo to howard city highway for a return to the m 82 designation .
the last change came in CD when the concurrency with m CD was eliminated in favor of m CD .
the m 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of fremont , resulting in the current highway routing .

previously inhabited by the choctaw native americans , the area now called meridian was obtained by the united states under the terms of the treaty of dancing rabbit creek in CD during the period of indian removal .
after the treaty was ratified , european american settlers began to move into the area .
after receiving a federal land grant of about CD CD acres CD ha , richard mclemore , the first settler of meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area .

john t. ball , a merchant from kemper county , bought the remaining CD acres CD CD km2 .
ragsdale and ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections .
there was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement .
ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name meridian , believing the term to be synonymous with junction .

the town boomed in the aftermath of the civil war , and experienced its golden age from CD to CD .
the railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom .
as the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area .
between CD and CD , meridian was the largest city in mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the south .
many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the grand opera house in CD , the wechsler school in CD , CD carnegie libraries in CD , and the threefoot building , meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in CD .

papa stour is CD of the shetland islands in scotland , with a population of under CD people , some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s .
located to the west of mainland shetland and with an area of CD hectares CD CD square miles , papa stour is the eighth largest island in shetland .
erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , and cliffs .
the island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife .
the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around the island are a special area of conservation .
the island has several neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of duke hakon 's 13th century house dating from the norse occupation of the island .
the population reached CD or more in the nineteenth century , when a fishing station was opened at crabbaberry in west voe .
subsequently there was a steady decline in population , although the numbers have increased from a low of CD in the 1970s .
today the main settlement on the island is biggings , just to the east of which is housa voe from where the snolda ferry arrives from its base at west burrafirth on the shetland mainland .
crofting , especially sheep rearing , is the mainstay of island life .
numerous shipwrecks have occurred around the coast , and the celebrated poem da sang o da papa men by vagaland recalls the drama of the days when papa stour was a centre for deep sea fishing .
papa stour is located at the south western end of st magnus bay .
there are CD kilometres CD mi of rugged coastline which is indented by numerous small embayments and CD larger voes .
hamna voe old norse harbour bay in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch .
housa voe to the east old norse house bay is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry 's embarkation point .
brei holm and maiden stack guard the harbour entrance to the south .
the former is a tidal island and was a leper colony until the 18th century although it has been suggested that many of the lepers there were suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather than leprosy .
the latter 's name relates to a story from the 14th century .
lord thorvald thoresson is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to preserve his daughter from men .
unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be pregnant .
in another version of the story , she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped .
west voe , the inner part of which is called robies noust is the main voe in the north coast , the smaller culla voe lying immediately to the west .
the main settlement on the island today is biggings , which overlooks housa voe and is surrounded by in bye land to the east of the hill dyke which runs south from west voe .
to the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about CD and a half kilometres in length .
much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till .
there is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile .
the lack of peat led to turf scalping for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior .
the highest point on the island is in the north west at virda field , which rises to CD metres CD feet .
virda is possibly from the old norse for heap of stones .
in addition to the larger islets mentioned above there are various other isles and skerries around the coast of papa stour .
the ve skerries lie CD kilometres CD CD CD to the north west .
they include helliogoblo , north skerry , ormal , reaverack and the clubb .
in between papa stour and ve skerries lies the shallow bank of papa rof .
on CD june CD , stuart hill , the owner and only resident of the CD hectare CD CD acres island of forewick holm which he has renamed forvik island made a declaration of dependence , creating the crown dependency of forvik .
on the basis of a marriage arrangement between king christian of norway and king james iii of scotland that dates to CD , hill argued that the island should be considered a british crown dependency , and thus not a part of the united kingdom or of the european union .
this claim was not recognised by the united kingdom .
the island is composed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the devonian period .
at that time the scottish landmass formed part of the old red sandstone continent and lay some CD CD degrees south of the equator .
the accumulations of old red sandstone , laid down from CD to CD CD years ago , were created as earlier silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of pangaea , eroded and then were deposited into river deltas .
the freshwater lake orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from shetland to the southern moray firth .
the structure of papa stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava rhyolite , but there is also a devonian fish bed at lamba banks .
there are numerous large boulders deposited by pleistocene glaciation .
erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , cliffs , voes and geos that are amongst the finest in britain .
the holl o boardie is a cave that passes right through the north west tip of the island .
it is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through .
kirstan or christie 's hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in CD .
yet another is francie 's hole close to hamna voe in the west .
this was the favourite of john tudor who wrote of the island in his victorian memoirs and described the cave as
in fairyland , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so pellucid is the water with alcoves or recesses like stalls in a church .
in CD the spectacular headland , da horn o papa fell into the sea during a storm .
the nearby islet of brei holm also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit .
otters , grey seals , killer whales and harbour porpoises are frequently seen on and around papa stour .
atlantic puffin , arctic and common tern , bonxie and arctic skua , northern fulmar , common guillemot , razorbill , curlew , wheatear , ringed plover and great black backed gull all breed on the island , and numerous migratory species have been recorded .
there is a profusion of wild flowers , including mountain everlasting , spring squill and eyebright as well as the ubiquitous heather .
the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around papa stour are a special area of conservation .
the traditional shetland pony is still bred .
human settlement of the island dates from circa CD because and there are remains of several neolithic burial chambers known as heel shaped cairns .
papa stour is the subject of a CD manuscript written in old norse , which is the oldest surviving document from shetland .
it deals with a dramatic incident in the house of duke hakon magnusson , who was later to become king hakon v of norway .
there is a circle of stones near the beach at housa voe , which are the remains of a ting , or local assembly .
this was the scene of a duel , fought and won by lord thorvald thoresson , who was accused of corruption in the CD document and was later called dominus de papay .
the story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above .
the remains of duke hakon 's thirteenth century house are still visible near housa voe .
in CD shetland came under nominal scottish control , although the norse lairds of norway kept their papa stour estates until the 17th century .
in the 16th century merchants from bremen and hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet .
by the 18th century , CD scottish lairds , thomas gifford of busta , and arthur nicolson of lerwick , owned the island .
they maintained a prosperous haaf old norse deep sea fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using CD oared boats known as sixareens .
in addition to the leper colony on brei holm there may have been another at hilla fielle overlooking hamna voe .
a recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony .
the island church , which overlooks kirk sand in the bay of fore wick , was founded in CD .
CD metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of sneeans or snøyans on the headland between the west end of kirk sand and the bay of tusselby .
it is called the ald kirk by locals and referred to by the ordnance survey as the site of a romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century .
there is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night .
eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re commenced there successfully .
excavations in CD found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it .
in the 19th century the crabbaberry fishing station in west voe was opened and the island had a population of CD people or more .
however , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the CD on .
at this time another duel entered the history of papa stour .
edwin lindsay , an indian army officer and the son of the 6th earl of balcarres , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in CD .
he spent CD years as a prisoner before the quaker preacher catherine watson arranged for his release in CD .
lindsay 's well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe .
there are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as norse or clack mills , around dutch loch .
originally these were CD story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill stone was sited .
inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone , and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below .
some were still in use on papa stour in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of CD of these mills on the burn of clumlie , at troswick in the south mainland of shetland .
in common with many small scottish islands , papa stour 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then see e.g. mingulay .
by CD the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen fairly elderly residents , but an advertisement in exchange and mart reversed the decline .
a croft and CD sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants .
by CD the census recorded a population of CD .
however , by CD the population had fallen to CD after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases .
a number of people left the island and the school closed .
by early CD the population had dropped to just CD after a family of CD left .
the CD census recorded a usually resident population of CD during the decade CD CD scottish island populations as a whole grew by CD to CD CD .
overview of population trends
the coasts around papa stour have claimed numerous wrecks .
in hamnavoe , tiptans skerry alone has sunk dutch , french , german and norwegian ships .
the aberdeen trawler ben doran a178 , foundered on the ve skerries CD miles northwest of papa stour , on the evening of CD march CD while on her way to the village of scalloway to land her catch .
when she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck .
by the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers there being no lifeboat in shetland at that time , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries .
a request had been made for the stromness lifeboat from orkney , only CD miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help .
all CD crew perished in the wreck .
only CD bodies were recovered , that of james mitchell , which was returned to aberdeen , and the bodies of j. cormack and j.r. insh , which were buried in scalloway .
the cargo ship ss highcliffe ran aground in fog on forewick holm in february CD .
on this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost .
in CD the aberdeen trawler juniper ran aground in lyra sound at the bottom of the CD metres CD feet cliffs .
the CD man crew were rescued by the aith lifeboat , the coxswain being awarded the rnli silver medal for this rescue .
papa stour 's most recent shipwreck occurred on CD december CD when the aberdeen trawler elinor viking a278 , skipper alec flett , foundered on the ve skerries .
the aith lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions .
at the request of alec webster , coastguard station officer , lerwick , a volunteer crew in a british airways sikorsky s61n helicopter from sumburgh airport was scrambled .
they managed to winch all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the grounding , despite the storm force winds .
the helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery .
there was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in CD , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present search and rescue helicopter unit , based at sumburgh airport .
crofting is the mainstay of island life .
sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept , including cattle , pigs , goats , chickens , ducks and geese .
vegetable are grown too , often in the shelter of circular walls , such plots being known as plantie scrubs .
fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale .
there is a post office at the pier , but no shop .
mains electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century .
the papa stour project is a christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues .
ferries now sail across the sound of papa to west burrafirth on the shetland mainland .
the crossing takes CD minutes , and although the snolda carries cars , there is only CD short road on the island.for visiting yachts the CD main voes provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the sound of papa and to the north west require considerable care .
there is an airstrip which caters for regular flights from tingwall .
the papa stour sword dance may be of norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of england .
a description of the dance appears in the pirate by sir walter scott .
the writer and journalist john sands lived on papa stour and foula for a while during the late nineteenth century .
the writer , folklorist and musician , george p. s. peterson was brought up on papa stour .
it is also the papa of vagaland 's poem da sang o da papa men , now adopted as part of the folksong tradition , as set to music by t.m.y. manson .
the insistent chorus chant , rowin foula doon
, is particularly striking .
oot bewast da horn o papa ,
rowin foula doon
owir a hidden piece o water ,
rowin foula doon
roond da boat da tide lumps makkin ,
sunlicht trowe da cloods is brakkin
we maan geng whaar fish is takkin ,
rowin foula doon
rowin foula doon
refers to the fishermens practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of foula were no longer visible .
this entailed the boat being some CD kilometres CD CD west of papa stour .
the tide lumps are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide .
the resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to papa by the scent o flooers across the water .
this is an example of vagaland 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation .
an extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that da horn o papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature .
angel of death is the opening track on the american thrash metal band slayer 's CD album reign in blood .
the lyrics and music were written by slayer guitarist , jeff hanneman and are based on nazi physician josef mengele , who conducted human experiments at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii .
angel of death led to the band facing accusations of nazi sympathizing and racism throughout their career .
despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of reign in blood , angel of death is featured on all of slayer 's live albums and dvds and has appeared in several movies .
the song was well received by critics .
steve huey of allmusic described it as a classic .
slayer guitarist jeff hanneman wrote angel of death after reading books about nazi physician josef mengele while on tour with the band i remember stopping someplace where i bought CD books on mengele .
i thought , this has got to be some sick shit .
so when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head that is where the lyrics to angel of death came from .
the lyrics detail mengele 's surgical experiments on patients at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii .
mengele 's explorations were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations .
among the tests he performed that are mentioned in angel of death are experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , gassing , injections with lethal germs , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and abacination .
sewn together , joining heads .
just a matter of time til you rip yourselves apart , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation mengele stitched together twins , CD of them deformed .
the hunchback was sewn to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too .
this claim was first made by auschwitz survivor vera alexander at the CD trial of ss hauptscharführer adolf eichmann the architect of the holocaust , where it was asserted that mengele sewed the veins together and turned them into siamese twins .
this allegation became more widely known when vera alexander was featured in the CD documentary the search for mengele , which has been cited by several authors including gerald posner , an expert on mengele .
towards the end of the song , there is a line feeding off the screams of the mutants he is creating , which was taken from the film the boys from brazil in which dr. mengele was the villain .
the lyrical content of angel of death contributed to the delay of the release of slayer 's CD album reign in blood .
the band were signed to def jam records whose distributor , columbia records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork too graphic .
reign in blood was eventually distributed by geffen records on october CD , CD .
however , due to the controversy , reign in blood did not appear on geffen records official release schedule .
angel of death caused outrage among survivors of the holocaust , as well as their families and the general public .
the controversy led to accusations of nazi sympathizing which have followed slayer throughout their career .
people took hanneman 's interest in nazi history and his collection of nazi medals as evidence of sympathizing his most prized item being a german knight 's cross .
hanneman counteracted asserting
i know why people misinterpret it it is because they get this knee jerk reaction to it .
when they read the lyrics , there is nothing i put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me well , is not that obvious
i should not have to tell you that .
according to guitarist kerry king yeah , slayer are nazis , fascists , communists all that fun shit .
and of course we got the most flak for it in germany .
i was always like , read the lyrics and tell me what is offensive about it .
can you see it as a documentary , or do you think slayer 's preaching fucking world war ii
people get this thought in their heads especially in europe and you will never talk them out of it .
the song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied .
the band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not condone racism and are merely interested in the subject .
in CD , the song jihad from slayer 's CD album christ illusion drew comparison to angel of death .

the bourgeois blues is a blues song by american folk and blues musician , lead belly .
it was written in june CD in response to the discrimination and segregation that lead belly faced during a visit to washington , dc to record for alan lomax .
it rails against racism , the jim crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary african americans in the southern united states .
the song was recorded in december CD for the library of congress and re recorded in CD for commercial release .
it has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including pete seeger , ry cooder , hans theessink , and billy bragg .
the bourgeois blues is regarded as CD of lead belly 's best original works , but it also drew controversy .
there is doubt over the song 's authorship , with some scholars contending that lead belly was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator .
questions have been raised over his role in the american communist party and whether he and the song were used to further the party 's political goals .
most music historians date the writing of the bourgeois blues to lead belly 's june CD trip to washington , dc , when he was invited by the folklorist alan lomax to record for the library of congress 's folk music collection .
lomax , in some versions of the story described as an unnamed white friend , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the supreme court building .
the next morning , lead belly awoke to lomax arguing with his landlord about the presence of a black man , with the landlord threatening to call the police .
while in washington , lead belly encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the impetus of the song .
for instance , when lead belly , lomax , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them .
lead belly was told that if he returned later without lomax , he would be served .
in response to CD of these incidents , a friend of lead belly 's , variously identified as either lomax or mary elizabeth barnicle joked that washington was a bourgeois town .
though lead belly did not know what the word bourgeois meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip .
the song came together quickly .
CD account claims that it only took a few hours for lead belly to write it .
lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment .
the bourgeois blues is a blues style protest song that criticizes the culture of washington , dc .
it protests against both the city 's jim crow laws and the racism of its white population .
its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to spread the news all around about the racial issues plaguing the city .
the song , particularly in the refrain , conflates race and economics by referring to caucasians as bourgeois .
the third verse sarcastically cites the home of the brave , the land of the free , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in washington , dc .
the fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song 's end , which suggests that african americans boycott buying homes in the district .
the song 's tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters .
despite this , by spreading the news of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern african americans and northern whites that the status quo is deeply flawed and that something needs to change .
the bourgeois blues follows a traditional CD bar blues format .
it is written in CD time but annotated to note that the song rhythmically should swing at medium shuffle .
the song was written in b .
it uses CD measures with verses CD to CD repeating , followed by the final CD verses and a coda .
lead belly first recorded the bourgeois blues in december CD in new york city , for donation to the library of congress .
he re recorded the song in april CD for musicraft records , for release the same year as a CD rpm record .
the version that was commercially released features lead belly singing and playing the CD string guitar without any other accompaniment .
the song has been covered and reinterpreted by a variety of artists including pete seeger and hans theessink .
seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums .
in australia , the song was reworked as canberra blues by the bitter lemons , an are b band .
the lyrics speak of the problems faced by young australians in the australian capital territory in the 1960s .
theessink adapted the song to his style of european blues for the album journey on in CD .
in CD , billy bragg reworked the song as bush war blues .
bragg 's cover is a topical protest song about the iraq war .
in CD verse , bragg claims that the iraq war was not for democracy but instead was to make the world safe for halliburton .
in another , he takes on the christian right , asking where the moderates are .
finally , bragg chides the united states government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war .
the bourgeois blues is CD of lead belly 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most heartfelt protest song .
there is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance .
robert springer claims that the song is peripheral to the wider study of the blues , while lawson points to it as a watershed in the way african americans see themselves in the fabric of the united states .
there is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics .
after its release , it became popular with left wing political groups .
lead belly was invited to perform at camp unity , the communist party usa 's summer retreat , and the fbi subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s .
this led to the accusations that the communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform .
the party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform .
jeff todd titon and several other writers have suggested that lead belly had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song .
this theory stems from the idea that lead belly did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by lomax .
since the music that lomax recorded was sold to northerners sympathetic to civil rights , it has been suggested that lomax helped him write a song attractive to a white audience .
lead belly admitted that the term bourgeois was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .

lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including french , spanish , italian , dutch , hebrew , hindi , polish and japanese .
the song talks about personal empowerment and self sufficiency , denoting a shift in focus of madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like everybody CD , vogue CD or music CD which was centered around the subject of music itself .
among the various remixes , the pet shop boys remix incorporated whitney houston 's i want to dance with somebody who loves me with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction .
pet shop boys and madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song heart CD for madonna but never delivered it .
the remix had added lyrics sung by band member neil tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album disco four .

the high five interchange is CD of the first CD level stack interchanges built in dallas , texas .
located at the junction of the lyndon b. johnson freeway interstate CD , i CD and the central expressway us highway CD , us CD , it replaces an antiquated partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s .
the CD CD project was started in CD and completed in december CD .
it was designed by the hntb corporation and built by zachry construction corporation .
the interchange is considered by popular mechanics to be CD of the world 's CD strangest roadways because of its height as high as a CD story building , its CD permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
in CD , the american public works association named the high five interchange as public works projects of the year .
the high five interchange , north of downtown in dallas , texas , is a massive CD level freeway interchange .
it is the junction of CD major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the lyndon b. johnson freeway interstate CD and the central expressway us CD , and is the first CD level stack interchange to be built in the city .
it replaces the antiquated CD level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing us CD down to CD lanes at the junction of the CD highways .
the looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic .
left hand exits contributed to the congestion .
further , its CD frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult .
alluding to the celebratory gesture , the high CD name refers to the CD flyover ramps handling the left turn movements that tower over the landscape .
the interchange is as high as a CD story building , and includes CD bridges spread across CD levels the high CD , CD support tiers , and CD miles of additional highway .
the highest ramps are CD feet CD m above ground .
the roads on the CD levels are
level i us CD , an CD lane highway , CD lanes going each way
level ii the junction of the CD CD lane frontage roads , each having CD through lanes in each direction , left turn lanes and turnarounds , and easy access to us CD and i CD
level iii i CD , CD regular lanes , CD going each way , and CD hov lanes CD going each way separated by barriers
level iv and v direct connection ramps CD levels , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf
the interchange , with its decorative etchings on precast concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the texas department of transportation txdot , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art .
the high five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the cottonwood trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange .
the section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the high CD project by txdot .
the interchange is considered by popular mechanics as CD of the world 's CD strangest roadways , calling it a labyrinth of lanes and a CD level marvel of engineering because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
the high five interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , antiquated interchange that accommodated CD CD vehicles daily and was located in CD of the most intensely developed commercial zones in dallas .
it was a collaborative project between the txdot , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , zachry construction .
an essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible .
reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access .
zachry construction corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the CD CD contract by txdot , the largest ever by that agency .
the construction contract for the high five interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts .
for example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength the first time txdot had ever done so , and contained an early completion bonus , a sliding scale of up to CD CD if the company completed the contract within CD years .
also built into the construction contract was a provision that zachry was charged for lane rentals by txdot for time they closed down traffic lanes fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed .
the fees ranged from CD to a high of CD CD for rush hours .
in order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes .
once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed .
little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished .
however , zachry decided to use precast concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by deal s.r.l. of italy and costing about CD CD , to move the pieces into place .
during the construction , CD CD CD cubic yards of earthwork was used , CD CD cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and CD CD square feet of retaining walls were built .
additionally , CD CD feet of drilled shafts and CD CD linear feet of drainage pipe were completed .
in addition to the construction of CD permanent bridges , CD temporary bridges were built , resulting in CD CD CD square feet of bridge deck .
the project was designed by the hntb corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in CD and was completed in december CD , more than CD months sooner than planned .
in CD , the american public works association named the high five public works project of the year for its massive size , its innovative design , the complexity and rapidity of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community .
txdot as the managing agency , zachry construction corporation as the primary contractor , and hntb corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project .

the trout creek mountains are a remote , semi arid great basin mountain range mostly in southeastern oregon and partially in northern nevada in the united states .
the range 's highest point is orevada view benchmark , CD CD feet CD CD m above sea level , in nevada .
disaster peak , elevation CD CD feet CD CD m , is another prominent summit in the nevada portion of the mountains .
the mountains are characteristic of the great basin 's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys .
oriented generally north to south , the trout creek mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other vents , on top of older metamorphic rocks .
the southern end of the range , however , features many granitic outcrops .
as a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons .
most of the range is public land administered by the federal bureau of land management .
there is very little human development in the remote region cattle grazing and ranching are the primary human uses but former mines at the mcdermitt caldera produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in north america in the 20th century .
public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited .
vegetation includes large swaths of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands .
sage grouse and mountain chickadee are CD bird species native to the range , and common mammals include pronghorn and jackrabbits .
despite the area 's dry climate , a few year round streams provide habitat for the rare lahontan cutthroat trout .
fish populations in the trout creek mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century .
in the 1980s , the effects of grazing allotments on riparian zones and the fish led to land use conflict .
the trout creek mountain working group was formed in CD to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties .
the stakeholders met and agreed on changes to land use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .
the trout creek mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern oregon and northern nevada , in harney and humboldt counties .
the nearest human settlements are the whitehorse ranch , about CD miles CD km directly north from the middle of the mountains .
fields , oregon , about CD miles CD km to the northwest .
denio , nevada , about CD miles CD km to the west .
and mcdermitt , nevada oregon , about CD miles CD km to the east .
the mountains are about CD miles CD km directly southwest of boise , idaho , and about CD miles CD km northeast of reno , nevada .
the range and surrounding non mountainous areas cover an area of CD square miles CD CD km2 .
the mountains run CD miles CD km north to south and CD miles CD km east to west .
more of the range is in oregon CD than in nevada CD .
the highest point in the range is orevada view benchmark , which is CD CD feet CD CD m above sea level and is located in nevada about CD mile south of the oregon border .
about CD miles southeast of orevada view is disaster peak , a large , symmetrical butte that is visible throughout the region .
at CD CD feet CD CD m , disaster peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub range called the granites .
the oregon canyon mountains border the trout creek mountains on the east along the harney malheur county line according to the united states geological survey 's definitions , while the pueblo mountains are the next range west of the trout creek mountains .
the bilk creek mountains in both oregon and nevada border the trout creek mountains on the southwest .
the CD ranges are separated by log cabin creek and south fork cottonwood creek .
south of the trout creek mountains is the kings river valley , which separates the bilk creek mountains on the west from the montana mountains on the east .
the terrain in the trout creek mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons .
the canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms .
there are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year round .
major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include from west to east cottonwood creek , trout creek , willow creek , and whitehorse creek .
these streams all flow into endorheic basins in harney county , oregon .
trout creek and whitehorse creek are the largest of the CD .
the kings river and mcdermitt creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the trout creek mountains .
the kings river begins in the granites and flows south into nevada , where it meets the quinn river , which evaporates in the black rock desert .
mcdermitt creek begins in oregon a few miles north of the granites and flows generally east , crossing the oregon nevada border CD times before disappearing into the floor of the quinn river valley south of mcdermitt .
the mountains lie within the basin and range province or great basin of the western united states , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north south mountain ranges separated by wide , high desert valleys .
the trout creek mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range .
the southern area of the range , known as the granites , has numerous outcroppings of cretaceous age granite .
these granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines .
the trout creek mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where steens mountain is today .
crustal thinning and the yellowstone hotspot , which was then beneath southeastern oregon , induced eruptions from steens and nearby vents about CD CD years ago , in the miocene .
the vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the trout creek mountains .
eruptions from the steens volcano lasted for about CD CD years , and at least CD separate lava flows occurred .
under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the triassic age formations of the blue mountains in northeastern oregon .
within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the cretaceous period .
the broad mcdermitt caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the trout creek mountains .
the oval shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the oregon nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the oregon canyon mountains .
it is about CD miles CD km long and CD miles CD km wide .
the lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early miocene .
a total of CD large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure .
the caldera formed when the dome collapsed about CD CD years ago .
the caldera contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at CD or more sites in and around the caldera .
other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony , cesium , and lithium .
the trout creek mountains are semi arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west .
when moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward over the oregon and california coastal ranges and the cascade range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the trout creek mountains .
as a result , the average annual precipitation in the trout creek mountains is only CD to CD inches CD to CD mm per year , with most areas receiving between CD and CD inches CD and CD mm annually .
much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of march and the end of june .
most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months .
snowpack at elevations below CD CD feet CD CD m usually melts by april .
however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid june .
local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts .
the prevailing winds are from the west southwest , and they are normally strongest in march and april .
brief , intense thunderstorms are common between april and october .
thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .
vegetation in the trout creek mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses .
other common shrubs include bitterbrush , snowberry , and ceanothus .
there are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas .
common grass species include idaho fescue , bluebunch wheatgrass , cheatgrass , western needlegrass , sandberg 's bluegrass , thurber 's needlegrass , and bottlebrush squirreltail , as well as basin wildrye in some well drained areas .
less than CD percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian greenways vegetation along stream banks .
however , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem .
the meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping uplands or in stream bottoms , and range in size from about CD to CD acres CD CD to CD CD ha .
narrow riparian greenways follow the year round streams .
many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves .
cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider .
sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms .
years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young aspen and willow trees .
restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s .
however , large wildfires in southeastern oregon during the summer of CD burned much of the range 's vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle .
animals in the trout creek mountains are adapted to the environment of the high desert .
pronghorn are common in the open , sagebrush covered basins , while mule deer live in the cottonwood and willow groves .
there are also bighorn sheep , cougars , and bobcats in the high country .
jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range .
mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the great basin .
some other mammals include the northern pocket gopher , mountain cottontail , and belding 's ground squirrel .
north american beavers live in and along streams , as do pacific tree frogs , western spadefoot toads , and garter snakes .
native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain chickadee , gray headed junco , black throated gray warbler , virginia 's warbler , macgillivray 's warbler , pine siskin , red crossbill , bushtit , hermit thrush , northern goshawk , and species of raven and eagle .
several streams in the trout creek mountains are home to trout , including the rare lahontan cutthroat trout subspecies .
these include willow creek , whitehorse creek , little whitehorse creek , doolittle creek , fifteen mile creek , indian creek , sage canyon creek , line canyon creek , and some tributaries of mcdermitt creek .
lahontan cutthroat trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the trout creek mountains .
these populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation .
for most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably .
it was listed under federal law as an endangered species in CD and was reclassified as threatened in CD .
reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , overfishing , competition with other fish , and hybridization with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure lahontan cutthroat trout .
however , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover .
the bureau of land management blm administers most land in the trout creek mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area .
the private lands are mainly used for ranching along mountain streams , while the blm lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers cattle .
at least CD mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since CD , some of which were staked for gold exploration .
commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the mcdermitt caldera , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted .
mines in what was called the opalite mining district produced CD CD flasks of mercury the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20th century .
the CD leading mercury producing mines in north america were the cordero and mcdermitt mines on the edge of the caldera in nevada .
together , they operated from CD to CD .
the mcdermitt mine , the last mercury mine in the united states , closed CD years later , in CD .
however , mineral exploration has continued at the cordero mine in the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of mcdermitt as part of a you.s. environmental protection agency cleanup project .
the entire mountain range is very remote .
as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness like experience .
camping , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities .
the only developed recreation site nearby is at willow creek hot springs , just south of the whitehorse ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for CD wheel off road vehicles .
hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , pronghorn , chukars , and rabbits .
fishing on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch and release basis .
the mountains are also suitable for hiking cross country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek bottoms .
there are more than CD archaeological sites in the range that document use by northern paiute people as long as CD CD years ago .
cattle grazing in the trout creek mountains began in the late 19th century , and the blm currently oversees grazing allotments in the area .
cattle can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months .
the effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s .
by the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the trout creek mountains and elsewhere in the great basin .
as a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones .
aspen populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures .
these conditions put the rare lahontan cutthroat trout population at risk .
since the lahontan was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the trout creek mountains .
beginning in the early 1970s , the bureau of land management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas .
approximately CD CD willow trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing .
next , the agency sought to reform land use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project .
as environmentalists pressed the blm to close much of the trout creek mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the sagebrush rebellion seeking to protect their grazing allotments .
initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades .
however , in CD , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the trout creek mountain working group .
the group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers economic needs .
initial members of the trout creek mountain working group included
over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers .
meetings were all open to the public .
the group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well being of ranchers .
in CD , the whitehorse ranch agreed to rest CD grazing allotments totaling CD CD acres CD CD ha to restore critical stream greenways and mountain pastures .
the ranch 's allotment on fifteen mile creek was rested for CD years , and its willow creek pasture received a CD year rest before grazing was resumed .
in addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from CD months to CD , and the total number of cattle released in the allotment areas was reduced from CD CD to CD CD .
finally , sensitive areas were fenced to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams .
other ranches also agreed to rest specific pastures including the trout creek , cottonwood creek , and whitehorse butte allotments .
in CD , the bureau of land management approved a new grazing allotment management plan .
it was based on the agreements made by the trout creek mountain working group , and it took effect in CD .
since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the trout creek mountains has recovered , and studies by the united states fish and wildlife service have found that the lahontan cutthroat trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .
mycena inclinata , commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak stump bonnet cap , is a species of mushroom in the family mycenaceae .
the doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish brown bell shaped cap up to CD CD cm CD CD in in diameter .
the gills are pale brown to pinkish , and the spore print is white .
it is a widespread saprobic fungus , and has been found in europe , north africa , asia , australasia , and north america , where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps , especially of oak .
british mycologist e.j.h. corner has described CD varieties of the mushroom from borneo .
lookalike species with which m. inclinata may be confused include m. galericulata and m. maculata .
first described as agaricus inclinatus by swedish mycologist elias magnus fries in CD , it was assigned its current name in CD by lucien quélet .
mycena galericulata var. calopus named by karsten in CD , and its basionym agaricus galericulatus var. calopus named by fries in CD , are synonyms .
in a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal dna sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid gastrodia confusa , m. inclinata was found to be closely related to m. aurantiomarginata , m. crocata , and m. leaiana .
the specific epithet inclinata means bent in .
the mushroom is commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak stump bonnet cap .
the cap is light reddish brown , with a diameter typically ranging from CD to CD CD cm CD CD to CD CD in .
initially conic to bell shaped to convex , it flattens during maturity , developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap .
the margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops .
the surface is moist and smooth , and hygrophanous .
the cap frequently develops splits in the margin , or cracks in the disc the central part of the cap .
the flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly mealy odor and taste .
the gills have a decurrent attachment to the stem that is , running down the length of the stem and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red .
they are broad between CD and CD mm , and have a close to subdistant spacing , with about CD CD gills reaching the stem .
the fragile stem is CD to CD cm CD CD to CD CD in long by CD CD to CD CD cm CD CD to CD CD in thick and yellow to yellow brown , becoming reddish brown to orange brown in the bottom half in maturity .
the lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks .
roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom , the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem .
the edibility of the mushroom is doubtful and consumption best avoided .
the spores are CD CD by CD CD CD , broadly ellipsoid , smooth , and strongly amyloid it turns black when treated with melzer 's reagent .
the basidia spore bearing cells are CD spored .
the pleurocystidia cystidia on the gill face are not differentiated .
the cheilocystidia cystidia on the gill edge are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous , club shaped , CD CD by CD CD , and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick .
the flesh of the gills is homogeneous , and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine .
the flesh of the cap has a distinct pellicle , a well differentiated hypoderm a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle , and a filamentous tramal body gill tissue .
it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain .
e.j.h. corner defined the varieties m. inclinata var. kinabaluensis and var. subglobospora in his CD publication on agaric mushrooms of malesia , a biogeographical region straddling the boundary of the indomalaya and australasia ecozones .
the variety kinabaluensis named after its type locality , kinabalu has a cap margin that is not scalloped , little or no odor , and cheilocystidia with shorter processes .
it was found growing on the dead wood of lithocarpus havilandii , a stone oak tree in the beech family .
variety subglobospora , found in sabah , has spores that are almost spherical .
mycena maculata bears some resemblance to m. inclinata , but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps , and is found in eastern north america , and sometimes on oak on the west coast .
in age , it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in m. inclinata .
m. inclinata is often confused with the edible m. galericulata , a common species that is variable in cap color , size and shape .
m. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray brown , and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross veins .
m. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish gray .
mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus , deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches .
it accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the CD major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter cellulose , hemicellulose and lignin .
the fruit bodies of mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps especially oak and chestnut during the spring and autumn .
the fungus forms a white , woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves .
occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree .
in eastern north america , it is abundant in the area bounded by nova scotia , ontario , manitoba , missouri , north carolina , and new york .
it has been found in oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the pacific coast .
the range of the fungus also includes europe , the canary islands , north africa , east siberia , japan , malesia , turkey , and new zealand .
in a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in ordu turkey , m. inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron CD mg per kg and nickel CD CD mg kg , measured on a dry weight basis .
laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum .
the fungus has been investigated for its ability to decolorize synthetic dyes that are used in the textile , plastics , biomedical and foodstuff industries .
the dyes are not readily biodegradable , and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic .
capel lligwy sometimes referred to as hen gapel lligwy is a ruined chapel near rhos lligwy in anglesey , north wales , dating back to the first half of the 12th century .
the chapel 's original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population .
it was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house , then later fell into disrepair .
the walls still remain , with some traces of render on them internally , but there is no roof .
it contains a 16th century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber .
it is a grade ii listed building , a national designation given to buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them , in particular because it is a substantially 12th century structure with the unusual 16th century vaulted south chapel .
the oldest parts of capel lligwy date from the first half of the 12th century .
this was a time when many churches on anglesey in north west wales were first built in stone following the end of viking raids and attempts by the normans to gain control of the island .
the reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown .
geraint jones , author of a CD guide to the churches of anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby .
yates and longley , authors of a CD guide to ancient anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of penrhos lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times .
despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right .
the chapel is sometimes referred to as hen gapel lligwy hen being the welsh word for old and capel meaning chapel .
the walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time .
a chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century .
a vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the pierce lloyds .
for a time , capel lligwy was used as a private place of worship for lligwy house , a venerable mansion once owned by the lloyd family which came into the possession of william irby , 1st baron boston , in the 18th century .
after the early part of the 18th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair .
the walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone .
capel lligwy is in the anglesey countryside near llanallgo .
the parish church of st gallgo , llanallgo is about CD CD miles CD CD km away .
part of the churchyard wall remains , showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches .
it is cared for by cadw , the welsh assembly government body responsible for the built heritage of wales , and is open to the public .
capel lligwy is built from rubble masonry .
at about CD feet CD CD m up the walls , the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks , showing where the 14th century rebuilding started .
the doorway is on the south side , headed by a plain arch , and dates from the 12th century .
there is a stone bellcote at the west end .
there is no structural division between the nave where the congregation would have sat and the chancel where the altar would have been located .
there are no window openings on the north side , but there is a blocked opening to the east about CD feet CD CD m wide and there are the remains of a window on the south wall .
there is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel .
the vault , which is about CD square feet CD CD m2 , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel .
limestone slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above .
a stone in the nave , about CD square feet CD CD m2 with a hole in the top , might once have been used as a churchyard cross .
capel lligwy has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a grade ii listed building the lowest of the CD grades of listing , designating buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them .
it was given this status on CD september CD and has been listed because it is important as a substantially 12th century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period , even though it is now in a ruinous condition .
cadw which is responsible for the inclusion of welsh buildings on the statutory lists also notes the unusual 16th century vaulted south chapel .
the 19th century antiquarian angharad llwyd mentioned the church in her history of anglesey .
she said that the architecture was of the rudest kind , which bears testimony to its great antiquity .
she recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , containing several human skeletons , which crumbled into dust , when exposed to the air .
she added that further exploration of the vault then revealed a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth .
a CD book about abandoned churches in wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of anglesey , and calls capel lligwy a medieval gesture of christian power in a land so obviously imbued with the spirit of a pagan past .
it notes that the wheel has turned full circle and capel lligwy today is just another ruined relic of a former age .
the authors describe the chapel as a simple , square building with a small and ruggedly austere south chapel , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape .

upsilon andromedae b abbreviated andromedae b , and b , occasionally designated upsilon andromedae ab to distinguish it from the red dwarf upsilon andromedae b , also named saffar , is an extrasolar planet approximately CD light years away from the sun in the constellation of andromeda .
the planet orbits the solar twin star , upsilon andromedae a , approximately every CD days .
discovered in june CD by geoffrey marcy and r. paul butler , it was CD of the first hot jupiters to be discovered .
it is also CD of the first non resolved planets to be detected directly .
upsilon andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system .
in july CD the international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars .
the process involved public nomination and voting for the new names .
in december CD , the iau announced the winning name was saffar for this planet .
the winning name was submitted by the vega astronomy club of morocco and honours the 11th century astronomer ibn al saffar of muslim spain .
like the majority of known extrasolar planets , upsilon andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity .
the variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the doppler shift of upsilon andromedae 's spectrum .
the planet 's existence was announced in january CD , together with CD cancri b and the planet orbiting tau boöit is .
like CD pegasi b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , upsilon andromedae b orbits very close to its star , closer than mercury does to our sun .
the planet takes CD CD days to complete an orbit , with a semimajor axis of CD CD au .
a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect upsilon andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found .
in the case of upsilon andromedae b , this lower limit is CD CD of the mass of jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater .
however , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around CD and the true mass may be about CD CD mj .
coplanarity is not to be assumed .
the mutual inclination between c and d is CD degrees .
given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that upsilon andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface .
the spitzer space telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the CD sides of upsilon andromedae b of about CD CD degrees celsius , ranging from minus CD to CD degrees to about CD CD to CD CD degrees celsius .
the temperature difference has led to speculation that upsilon andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing upsilon andromedae a.
sudarsky had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted upsilon andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere .
the cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiation .
between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a stratosphere of cooler gas .
the outer she will of dark , opaque , hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides pm planets , but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet .
the planet is unlikely to have large moons , since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system .
the planet with CD pegasi b was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by planetpol .
preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is CD CD times as large and CD CD times as massive as jupiter , meaning that the mean density is CD cm3 .
it has a geometric albedo of 0 CD in visible light .
upsilon andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star .
observations suggest that there is a hot spot on the star around CD away from the sub planetary point .
this may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star .
the mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of rs canum venaticorum variable stars , or the interaction between jupiter and its moon io .

as his acting career began to consume his schedule , radcliffe continued his education through on set tutors .
he admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work really difficult .
he achieved a grades in the CD as level exams that he took in CD , but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university .
part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write , and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience .
the paparazzi , they would love it , he told details magazine in CD .
if there were any parties going on , they would be tipped off as to where they were .
in CD , producer david heyman asked radcliffe to audition for the role of harry potter for the film adaptation of harry potter and the philosopher 's stone , the best selling book by british author j. k. rowling .
rowling had been searching for an unknown british actor to personify the character , and the movie 's director chris columbus recalled thinking , this is what i want .
this is harry potter , after he saw a video of the young actor in david copperfield .
CD months later , and after several auditions , radcliffe was selected to play the part .
rowling also endorsed the selection saying , i do not think chris columbus could have found a better harry .
radcliffe 's parents originally turned down the offer , as they had been told that it would involve CD films shot in los angeles .
warner bros. instead offered radcliffe a CD movie contract with shooting in the uk .

he is shocked to learn that the true story is being sensationalized for the screen .
the pair interview the cast and crew as suspects , discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths producer kenny neiderman had been having an affair with danbury .
rowdy beeman replaced carroll as director .
ruby dahl and ramona tangent , whose roles in the film will expand without danbury .
and mark bianco , a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet black , whose role he plays .
also questioned is hugo winston , the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against what he sees as a disrespectful production .
the production continues , and after the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering .
beeman discovers a severed finger in his sandwich , recognizing from its ring that it belonged to niederman .
when the sheriff shuts down production , black theorizes that the killer may target the crew 's hotel .
he and hollis arrive to find the body of the film 's publicist hanging from a rope .
the next day , a film extra gene simmons confesses to the killings .
black pokes holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator .

CD years later is the second episode of millennium to have been written by michael r. perry , who had previously penned the second season episode the mikado , and would provide a further CD scripts in the third season .
the episode was directed by thomas j. wright , who helmed a total of CD CD episodes across all CD seasons .
wright would also go on to direct millennium , the series crossover episode with its sister show the x files .
the episode features guest appearances by the members of the band kiss peter criss , ace frehley , gene simmons and paul stanley who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role .
however , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and fax updated scripts to the shooting locations .
ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode .
ace frehley was also unenthusiastic towards his role , and requested to play a CD pound black man instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the CD eddie murphy film the nutty professor .
he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to fabricate .
perry has described the production CD years later as being CD of the most gruelling of the series run , citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the because of this .
perry praised wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode .

this represented approximately CD CD CD households .
CD years later received mixed reviews from critics .
the a.v. club 's todd vanderwerff rated the episode a b .
vanderwerff felt that the episode 's comedic slant was necessary within the wider series , as he considered millennium 's dark tone to be prone to unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet for this .
vanderwerff found the script to be at its strongest when satirizing the character of frank black , but admitted that it falls apart when attempting to send up other subjects .
he also felt that the guest appearance by kiss felt unnecessary and contrived .
robert shearman and lars pearson , in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to the x files , millennium the lone gunmen , rated thirteen years later CD star out of CD .
shearman felt that the episode had the potential to be much better , but that the whole concept drowns in overkill .
he considered the episode 's characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy handed to fully execute anything meaningful .
criticism was also levelled at the guest roles by the members of kiss .

the former alignment of route CD in the northern part of trenton and in ewing township became route CD .
between CD and CD , the route CD freeway was built between the interstate CD interstate CD interchange and route CD in hamilton township .
a CD lane street , lamberton road , connected the CD freeway sections .
plans were then made to fill the gap between the CD freeway sections in trenton .
construction began in CD on the route CD freeway between route CD and the morrisville trenton railroad bridge .
the road was to include CD traffic lights at cass street and south warren street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the delaware river .
the tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by CD but was delayed after the army corps of engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel .
the roof was put in place in october CD and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on march CD , CD .
a restriction to trucks over CD tons was put in place and made permanent in november CD .
by the 2000s , the state gave the part of route CD south main street between route CD and route CD in lambertville to the city , and route CD was rerouted to use all of route CD and CD block of route CD .
prior to this , south main street had been turned CD way southbound .
route CD , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with route CD .
the first mongol invasions of burma myanmar burmese were a series of military conflicts between kublai khan 's yuan dynasty , division of the mongol empire , and the pagan empire that took place between CD and CD .
the invasions toppled the CD year old pagan empire , and the mongol army seized pagan territories in present day dehong , yunnan and northern burma to tagaung .
the invasions ushered in CD years of political fragmentation in burma and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia .
the mongols first demanded tribute from pagan in CD CD , as part of their drive to encircle the song dynasty of china .
when king narathihapate refused , emperor kublai khan himself sent another mission in CD , again demanding tribute .
it too was rejected .
in CD , the emperor ordered the yunnan government to secure the borderlands in order to block an escape path for the song , and permitted a limited border war if pagan contested .
pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the mongol army in CD CD .
after a brief lull , kublai khan in CD turned his attention to southeast asia , demanding tribute from pagan , the khmer empire , việt and champa .
when the burmese king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern burma .
CD dry season campaigns CD CD later , the mongols had occupied down to tagaung and hanlin , forcing the burmese king to flee to lower burma .
the mongols organized northern burma as the province of zhengmian .
ceasefire negotiations began in CD , and ended with narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in june CD .
but the treaty never really took effect as narathihapate was assassinated in july CD , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged .
the mongol command at yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central burma .
they may not have reached pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to tagaung .
the pagan empire disintegrated and anarchy ensued .
the mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next CD years .
in march CD , they accepted the voluntary submission of king kyawswa of pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of pagan bagan .
but kyawswa was overthrown CD months later , and the mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion in CD CD .
marco polo reported the first invasions CD CD in his travelogue , il milione .
the burmese referred to the invaders as the taruk after the central asian turkic troops that largely made up the mongol invasion army .
today , the term taruk refers to the han chinese instead .
king narathihapate is unkindly remembered in burmese history as taruk pye min , the king who fled from the taruk .
in the 13th century , the pagan empire , along with the khmer empire , was CD of the CD main empires in mainland southeast asia .
for much of its history , pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not china but the independent dali kingdom and its predecessor nanzhao , both with dali as their capital city .
dali based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times allying themselves with the tibetan empire to their west and at other times with china 's tang and song dynasties .
indeed , nanzhao 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of pagan and the pagan dynasty itself .
then as now , the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges .
the mongol empire first arrived at the doorstep of the pagan empire in CD by invading the dali kingdom in its attempt to outflank song china .
the mongol armies captured the capital , dali , on CD january CD , and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by CD .
the arrival of the mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the mongols were intent on finishing off the song .
for the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from china to burma and india .
the mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by turkic speaking muslims from central asia , in CD circuits of the former dali kingdom .
by then , the pagan empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century .
the continuous growth of tax free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom .
the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges .
although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in CD CD in south arakan and martaban mottama , the decline continued .
on the eve of the mongol invasions , between CD and CD thirds of upper burma 's cultivable land had been donated to religion .
the crown 's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy .
the period of calm for pagan ended in the early 1270s .
by then , the song were on the ropes , and emperor kublai khan , who officially founded the yuan dynasty on CD december CD , sought to cut off the retreat of song refugees in all directions .
in pagan 's case , he had ordered the mongol governor of dali to tighten control of the borderlands , and in january CD to send a mission to pagan to demand tribute .
the tribute he demanded was nominal .
given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at pagan .
at the border , the ruler of the wa and palaung regions submitted to the mongols .
when the mongol envoys led by qidai tuoyin showed up , the pagan court led by chief minister ananda pyissi was well aware of the military power of the mongols and advised king narathihapate to use diplomacy .
the king was furious at the demand and kept the mongol envoys waiting for weeks .
the court finally devised a compromise the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king .
accompanying them was a burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the burmese king 's wish to CD day worship a buddha tooth at beijing .
the king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious borderland regions in april CD .
the rebel leader a pi was brought back to pagan .
dali relayed the news to beijing but did not carry out any military action .
at beijing , kublai khan , who was preparing an invasion of japan , decided against a war with pagan for the time being .
on CD march CD , he sent a CD member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the first secretary to the board rites , to pagan .
the delegation carried a letter from the emperor .
the letter says
if you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the all highest , send CD of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with us , and enter into a perpetual alliance .
this will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests .
for if it comes to war , who will be the victor
ponder well , o king , our words .
this time , the burmese king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit .
the burmese chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed .
but both burmese inscriptional evidence and yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed .
at any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to yunnan in due time .
the newly formed yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route .
meanwhile , in CD , the former dali kingdom was officially reorganized as the province of yunnan , with sayyid ajjal shams al din omar as governor .
in may CD , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned .
that the burmese evidently had no intention of submitting .
and that war was the only way forward .
but the emperor rejected an outright invasion .
just coming off a disastrous japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair .
he was now focused on delivering the final blow against the song .
the emperor ordered the yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the song refugees .
he also sanctioned a limited border war if pagan contested the takeover .
as planned , the yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in CD CD .
elsewhere , the main mongol armies had captured most of the song territory by CD .
by CD , at least CD burmese vassal state named gold teeth modern yingjiang had submitted to the mongols .
like in CD , the burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state .
but unlike in CD , the mongols had posted a sizable garrison there .
what followed was a border war in CD CD .
it was reported mainly in the yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of marco polo .
although the burmese chronicles have no record of the border war , a CD burmese inscription mentions the army 's defeat at ngasaunggyan .
the mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate .
according to the yuan dynasty chronicle and marco polo 's accounts , a burmese army invaded the mongol territory of gold teeth , and was defeated by the mongol army in april CD .
the battle took place either at the vochang valley in present day baoshan prefecture or CD km southwest at kanngai present day yingjiang , dehong prefecture , which the burmese called ngasaunggyan .
the yuan chronicle reports that only CD men defeated a burmese army of CD CD to CD CD with CD CD horses and CD elephants .
it also reports only CD mongol was killed , in trying to catch an elephant .
even then , the CD CD to CD CD figures of the burmese army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high .
the mongols may have erred on the side of generosity not to diminish their glory in defeating superior numbers .
but the mongol commander huthukh did not panic .
he ordered his troops to dismount , and from the cover of the nearby treeline , aim their bows directly at the advancing elephants .
the mongol archers arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled .
the mongol army pressed on after the monsoon season .
in the following dry season of CD CD , c .
december CD , a mongol army of CD led by nasr al din , son of gov. sayyid ajjal , advanced to kaungsin , which defended the bhamo pass .
they occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned stockades .
but they found the heat excessive and returned .
despite the mongol military success , the control of the borderlands remained contested .
pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the burmese , apparently taking advantage of mongol preoccupations elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at kaungsin and ngasaunggyan later in CD , posting permanent garrisons commanded by einda pyissi .
but their control was short lived .
the great khan 's attention turned to southeast asia once more in CD .
he had had mixed success his vaunted forces had finished off the last of the song in CD but had again failed to take japan in CD .
that year , the mongol emperor sent another mission to pagan , demanding tribute yet again .
the burmese king was to send his CD senior ministers accompanied by CD CD cavalry officers to the emperor 's court .
with champa , the emperor summoned the king of champa himself to beijing .
at pagan , narathihapate deliberated with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit .
the burmese court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern burma .
he also ordered an invasion of champa , whose king too had refused to submit .
the burmese king 's troubles did not go unnoticed elsewhere in the kingdom .
in the same year , a usurper named wareru seized the southern port city of martaban mottama by killing its pagan appointed governor .
although the king 's CD sons were viceroys of the nearby lower burma cities in bassein pathein , prome pyay , and dala , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not or could not take any action on martaban .
throughout CD , the mongol command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of champa and northern burma .
the objective of the burma campaign was to take over northern burma but no further .
the emperor did not sanction an attack on pagan itself .
at least CD army consisted of CD CD men of the erstwhile persian khwarezmid empire under the command of yalu beg was sent to yunnan to reinforce the burma invasion force , which again was made up of turks and other central asians .
on the burmese side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one .
by mid CD , a burmese army led by generals ananda pyissi and yanda pyissi was deployed at a fort at ngasaunggyan .
the invasion began on CD september CD .
prince sangqudar was the commander in chief of the invasion force .
his deputies were vice governor taipn , and commander yagan tegin .
the mongol armies marched to the border in CD columns .
CD column advanced along the taping river using over CD boats .
the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the burmese fort at ngasaunggyan .
the burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated .
the chronicles say that the burmese army numbered CD CD men while the mongol army numbered CD CD men and CD CD horses .
the burmese withstood the siege for over CD months but the fort fell on CD december CD .
the defeat at ngasaunggyan broke the back of burmese defenses .
the burmese army lost several CD men as well as senior commanders .
kaungsin , the next fort inline , fell just CD days later on CD december CD .
the mongol sources say that the burmese lost CD CD men at kaungsin .
the mongol armies pushed farther south into the irrawaddy valley .
they took the ancient burmese capital of tagaung , about CD km north of pagan on CD february CD .
there , the invaders paused their advance .
they found the heat of the searing irrawaddy valley excessive , and evacuated tagaung , allowing the burmese to return to tagaung on CD may CD .
but the mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season .
they retook tagaung , and defeated another burmese stand south of tagaung , probably near hanlin , on CD january CD , opening the way to pagan , about CD km south .
after the defeat , the king panicked , and fled to lower burma .
the evacuation proved premature .
the mongol forces did not advance on pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan .
the country fell into chaos .
in lower burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack .
although his sons ruled the key lower burma ports prome , dala and bassein , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at hlegya , west of prome .
without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one .
the governor of pegu revolted that same year .
the king managed to send CD small expeditions to pegu but they both failed .
now , the entire eastern half of lower burma pegu and martaban was in open revolt .
given his precarious position , narathihapate decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the mongols .
in november december CD , the king ordered his generals ananda pyissi and maha bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations .
the mongol commanders at hanlin , who had organized northern burma as a protectorate named zhengmian chinese .
wade giles cheng mien , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission .
they repeated their CD demand that the burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor .
the CD sides had reached a tentative agreement by CD march CD , which calls for a full submission of the pagan empire , and central burma to be organized as the province of mianzhong chinese .
wade giles mien chung .
after a long deliberation , the king agreed to submit but wanted the mongol troops to withdraw .
in june CD , he sent an embassy led by shin ditha pamauk , a learned monk , to the emperor 's court .
in january CD , the embassy arrived at beijing , and was received by the yuan emperor .
the burmese delegation formally acknowledged mongol suzerainty of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country .
indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal .
in exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops .
for the emperor , the burma campaign was the only bright spot .
his other southeast asian expeditions had gone badly .
he did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom .
he preferred a vassal ruler .
the burmese embassy arrived back at hlegya in may CD , and reported the terms to the king .
but the agreement broke down a month later .
in late june , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for pagan .
but on CD july CD , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son thihathu , the viceroy of prome .
anarchy ensued .
each region in the country which had not revolted broke away .
no successor to narathihapate , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of beijing , emerged .
indeed , a king would not emerge until may CD .
given the chaos , the governor of yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation .
the mongol army commanded by prince ye sin timour , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward pagan .
according to mainstream traditional british colonial era scholarship , the mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate .
fought its way down to pagan with the loss of CD men .
occupied the city .
and sent out detachments to receive homage , CD of which reached south of prome .
but not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary mongol chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest .
recent research shows that the mongol forces most probably never reached pagan .
they were held at bay by the burmese defenses led by commanders athinkhaya , yazathingyan and thihathu , and probably never got closer than CD km north of pagan .
an inscription dated CD february CD by the CD brothers claimed that they defeated the mongol army .
even if the mongols did reach pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal .
at any rate , the mongol army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to tagaung .
they remained there as the treaty was now void .
the disintegration of the pagan empire was now complete .
but the mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created .
they would send no more expeditions to restore order .
the emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to pacify the fragmented country .
indeed , his real aim all along may have been to keep the entire region of southeast asia broken and fragmented .
it would be another CD years until CD of narathihapate 's sons , kyawswa , emerged as king of pagan in may CD .
but the new king controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army .
the real power in central burma now rested with the CD commander brothers .
the uneasy arrangement would persist until CD .
the mongols continued to occupy northern burma to tagaung as the province of zhengmian cheng mien but ended the fictional central burma province of mianzhong on CD august CD .
meanwhile , the power struggle in central burma continued with the CD brothers blatantly consolidating support .
to check their rising power , kyawswa submitted to the mongols in january CD , and was recognized by the yuan emperor temür khan as king of pagan on CD march CD .
the emperor also gave chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of kyawswa .
the brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power .
on CD december CD , the CD brothers overthrew kyawswa , and founded the myinsaing kingdom .
the dethronement forced the mongol government to intervene again , leading to the second mongol invasion of burma CD CD .
the invasion failed .
CD years later , on CD april CD , the mongols abolished the province of zhengmian cheng mien , evacuated tagaung , and returned to yunnan .
the war was CD of several near simultaneous wars waged by the mongol empire and the yuan dynasty in the late 13th century .
though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in burma .
the invasions ushered in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia .
the immediate result of the war was the collapse of the pagan empire .
however , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not because it .
pagan 's disintegration was in fact more prolonged and agonized .
the kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century .
had pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country could have risen again .
but the dynasty could not recover , and because the mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath .
as a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century .
it was only in the late 14th century that CD relatively strong powers emerged in the irrawaddy basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy .
the vast region surrounding the irrawaddy valley would continue to be made up of several small tai shan states well into the 16th century .
perhaps the most enduring legacy of the mongol invasions was the emergence of tai shan states in mainland southeast asia .
the tai shan people who came down with the mongol invasions stayed .
by the early 14th century , several tai shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present day assam to northern and eastern myanmar to northern and central thailand and laos .
their rise was encouraged by the mongols , who viewed the states as a useful buffer between yunnan and the rest of southeast asia .
the mongols , who were still trying to incorporate yunnan into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of yunnan into the fold .
the integration of yunnan itself into china proper was to take several more centuries , and continues to today .
as such , from the newly formed tai shan states in western and central southeast asia to dai viet and champa in eastern southeast asia , the mongols elected to receive nominal tribute .
though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the yuan government , they were the native chieftains , who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased .
the war also marked the arrival of china at the doorstep of burma .
the old dali kingdom , known to the burmese as gandalarit , after gandhara raj was now a mongol chinese province .
the burmese now called the new powers at yunnan taruk after the turkic speaking soldiers of yunnan .
over the years , the term taruk came to be used to refer to the han chinese .
today , king narathihapate is remembered as taruk pye min , the king who fled from the taruk chinese .
from a geopolitical standpoint , the mongol chinese presence in yunnan pushed the shan migrations in the direction of burma and parts of the khmer empire .
the raids by various shan states into upper burma would continue until the mid 16th century .
during the official visit by the president tsakhiagiin elbegdorj to myanmar in november CD , aung san suu kyi , the chairperson of national league for democracy , said this was the first ever mongol mission since the mongols came CD years earlier .
it took place from CD CD september CD , on guadalcanal in the solomon islands , and was the second of CD separate major japanese ground offensives during the guadalcanal campaign .
in the battle , you.s. marines , under the overall command of you.s. major general alexander vandegrift , repulsed an attack by the japanese 35th infantry brigade , under the command of japanese major general kiyotake kawaguchi .
the marines were defending the lunga perimeter that guarded henderson field on guadalcanal , which was captured from the japanese by the allies in landings on guadalcanal on CD august CD .
kawaguchi 's unit was sent to guadalcanal in response to the allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the allied forces from the island .
underestimating the strength of allied forces on guadalcanal about CD CD kawaguchi 's CD CD soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the you.s. defenses .
the main japanese assault occurred around lunga ridge south of henderson field , manned by troops from several you.s. marine corps units , primarily troops from the 1st raider and 1st parachute battalions under you.s. marine corps lieutenant colonel merritt a. edson .
although the marine defenses were almost overrun , kawaguchi 's attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the japanese .
because of the key participation by edson 's unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as edson 's ridge in historical accounts of the battle in western sources .
after edson 's ridge , the japanese continued to send troops to guadalcanal for further attempts to retake henderson field , affecting japanese offensive operations in other areas of the south pacific .
on CD august CD , allied forces primarily you.s. landed on guadalcanal , tulagi , and florida islands in the solomon islands .
the landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the you.s. and australia .
they were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major japanese base at rabaul and support the allied new guinea campaign .
the landings initiated the CD month long guadalcanal campaign .
vandegrift placed his CD CD troops of the 1st marine division on guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the lunga point area .
on CD august , the airfield was named henderson field after major lofton henderson , a marine aviator who had been killed at the battle of midway .
the allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of henderson field were called the cactus air force after the allied code name for guadalcanal .
the 17th army heavily involved with the japanese campaign in new guinea had only a few units available to send to the southern solomons area .
of these units , the 35th infantry brigade under major general kiyotake kawaguchi was at palau , the 4th aoba infantry regiment was in the philippines and the 28th ichiki infantry regiment under the command of colonel kiyonao ichiki was embarked on transport ships near guam .
the different units began to move toward guadalcanal immediately .
ichiki 's regiment the closest arrived first .
the first element of ichiki 's unit consisting of about CD soldiers landed from destroyers at taivu point CD CD CD s CD CD CD e , about CD CD CD km east of the lunga perimeter , on august CD .
underestimating the strength of allied forces on guadalcanal , ichiki 's first element conducted a nighttime frontal assault on marine positions at alligator creek on the east side of the lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of august CD .
ichiki 's assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the battle of the tenaru all but CD of the CD men of the first element including ichiki himself were killed in the battle .
the survivors returned to taivu point , notified 17th army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from rabaul .
by CD august , kawaguchi 's unit had reached truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to guadalcanal .
because of the damage caused by allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the battle of the eastern solomons , the japanese decided not to deliver kawaguchi 's troops to guadalcanal by slow transport ship .
instead , the ships carrying kawaguchi 's soldiers were sent to rabaul .
from there , the japanese planned to deliver kawaguchi 's men to guadalcanal by destroyers , staging through a japanese naval base in the shortland islands .
the japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down the slot to guadalcanal and back in a single night , minimizing their exposure to allied air attack .
however , most of the soldiers heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to guadalcanal with them .
these high speed destroyer runs to guadalcanal , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the tokyo express by allied forces and rat transportation by the japanese .
the japanese controlled the seas around the solomon islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the allies .
however , any japanese ship remaining within the CD CD CD km range of the aircraft at henderson field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks .
this curious tactical situation held for several months .
on CD august , CD of kawaguchi 's troops were loaded onto the destroyers asagiri , amagiri , yugiri , and shirakumo , designated destroyer division CD dd20 .
at CD CD that day , CD you.s. dive bombers from vmsb CD under the command of lt. col. richard mangrum , flew from henderson field and located and attacked dd20 about CD CD CD km north of guadalcanal , sinking asagiri and heavily damaging yugiri and shirakumo .
amagiri took shirakumo in tow and the CD destroyers returned to the shortlands without completing their mission .
the attack on dd20 killed CD of kawaguchi 's soldiers and CD crew members .
subsequent express runs were more successful .
between CD august and CD september , various japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost CD CD troops at taivu point , including all of the 35th infantry brigade , CD battalion of the aoba regiment , and the rest of ichiki 's regiment .
general kawaguchi , who landed at taivu point on the CD august express run , was placed in command of all the japanese troops on guadalcanal .
in spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to guadalcanal by slow barges .
therefore , a convoy carrying CD CD of kawaguchi 's troops and heavy equipment in CD barges , mainly from the 2nd battalion , 124th infantry regiment under the command of colonel akinosuka oka , departed the northern coast of santa isabel island on CD september .
on CD CD september , aircraft from henderson field attacked the barge convoy , killing about CD of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit 's heavy equipment .
most of the remaining CD CD troops were able to land near kamimbo CD CD CD s CD CD CD e , west of the lunga perimeter over the next few days .
by CD september , kawaguchi had CD CD troops at taivu point and CD CD west of the lunga perimeter .
kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th army for delivery of CD more infantry battalion to augment his forces .
kawaguchi believed that there were only about CD CD you.s. marines on guadalcanal .
during this time , vandegrift continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the lunga perimeter .
between CD august and CD september , he relocated CD marine battalions including the 1st raider battalion , under you.s. lieutenant colonel merritt a. edson edson 's raiders , and the 1st parachute battalion from tulagi and gavutu to guadalcanal .
these units added about CD CD troops to vandegrift 's original CD CD men defending henderson field .
the 1st parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties in the battle of tulagi and gavutu tanambogo in august , was placed under edson 's command .
kawaguchi set the date for his attack on the lunga perimeter for CD september and began marching his forces west from taivu towards lunga point on CD september .
he radioed 17th army and requested that it carry out air strikes on henderson field beginning on CD september , and that naval warships be stationed off lunga point on september CD to destroy any americans who attempted to flee from the island .
on CD september , kawaguchi issued his attack plan to rout and annihilate the enemy in the vicinity of the guadalcanal island airfield .
kawaguchi 's plan called for his forces to split into CD , approach the lunga perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack .
oka 's force would attack the perimeter from the west while ichiki 's second echelon renamed the kuma battalion would attack from the east .
the main attack would be by kawaguchi 's center body , numbering CD CD men in CD battalions , from the south of the lunga perimeter .
by CD september , most of kawaguchi 's troops had started marching from taivu towards lunga point along the coastline .
about CD japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade 's supply base at taivu .
meanwhile , native island scouts directed by british government official and officer in the british solomon islands protectorate defence force , martin clemens told the marines of japanese troops at taivu , near the village of tasimboko , about CD CD CD km east of lunga .
edson launched a raid against the japanese troops at taivu .
destroyer transports uss mckean and manley and CD patrol boats took CD of edson 's men to taivu in CD trips .
edson and his first wave of CD troops landed at taivu at CD CD local time on CD september .
supported by aircraft from henderson field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , edson 's men advanced towards tasimboko village but were slowed by japanese resistance .
at CD CD , the rest of edson 's men landed .
with this reinforcement and more support from the henderson field aircraft , edson 's force pushed into the village .
the japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an allied supply ship convoy heading towards lunga point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind CD dead .
CD marines were killed .
in tasimboko , edson 's troops discovered the supply base for kawaguchi 's forces , including large stockpiles of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a shortwave radio .
the marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the lunga perimeter at CD CD .
the quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least CD CD japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack .
the ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended .
edson and thomas tried to persuade vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge , but vandegrift refused , believing that the japanese were more likely to attack along the coast .
finally , thomas convinced vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for edson 's raiders to rest from their actions of the preceding month .
on CD september , the CD men of edson 's unit including the 1st raiders and the paramarines deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it .
kawaguchi 's center body of troops was planning to attack the lunga perimeter at the ridge , which they called the centipede mukade gata because of its shape .
on CD september , kawaguchi 's troops left the coast at koli point .
split into CD columns , they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield .
lack of good maps , at least CD faulty compass , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag , costing a lot of time .
at the same time , oka 's troops approached the lunga perimeter from the west .
oka had some intelligence on the marine defenses , extracted from a you.s. army pilot captured on CD august .
during the day of CD september , kawaguchi 's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night 's attacks .
kawaguchi wanted his CD center body battalions in place by CD CD , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after CD CD .
oka was also delayed in his advance towards the marine lines in the west .
only the kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time .
despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured you.s. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the marine defenses .
japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on CD CD september , causing a few casualties , including CD killed .
the americans knew of the approach of the japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack .
the ridge around which edson deployed his men consisted of CD distinct hillocks .
at the southern tip and surrounded on CD sides by thick jungle was hill CD so named because it rose CD ft CD m above sea level .
CD CD yards north was hill CD CD ft CD m high , the dominant feature on the ridge .
the northernmost hillock was unnamed and about CD ft CD m high .
edson placed the CD companies from the raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the CD parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from hill CD back to hill CD .
CD of the CD raider companies , b and c , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy lagoon , and the lunga river .
machine gun teams from e company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses .
edson placed his command post on hill CD .
at CD CD on CD september , the japanese cruiser sendai and CD destroyers shelled the lunga perimeter for CD minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight .
japanese artillery began shelling the marine lines , but did little damage .
at the same time , scattered groups of kawaguchi 's troops began skirmishing with marines around the ridge .
kawaguchi 's 1st battalion led by major yukichi kokusho attacked the raider 's c company between the lagoon and the lunga river , overrunning at least CD platoon and forcing the marine company to fall back to the ridge .
kokusho 's unit became entangled with troops from kawaguchi 's 3rd battalion under lieutenant colonel kusukichi watanabe , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the japanese attack on the ridge that night .
kawaguchi , who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the you.s. marine lines as well as coordinating his troops attacks , later complained , due to the devilish jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control .
in my whole life i have never felt so disappointed and helpless .
CD you.s. marines were killed .
japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater .
although both oka in the west and the kuma unit in the east tried to attack the marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the marine lines at dawn .
at first light on CD september , cactus air force aircraft and marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle .
the japanese suffered several casualties , including CD officers from watanabe 's battalion .
at CD CD , kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night .
expecting the japanese to attack again that night , edson directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge .
after a failed attempt by CD companies to retake the ground on the marine right flank lost to kokusho the night before , edson repositioned his forces .
he pulled his front back about CD yd CD m to a line that stretched CD CD yd CD CD m , starting at the lunga river and crossing the ridge about CD yd CD m south of hill CD .
around and behind hill CD he placed CD companies .
any japanese attackers surmounting hill CD would have to advance over CD yd CD m of open terrain to close with the marine positions at hill CD .
with only a few hours to prepare , the marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications .
they were low on ammunition , with CD or CD grenades for each marine .
vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd battalion , 5th marine regiment CD CD to move into a position just to the rear of edson 's troops .
in addition , a battery of CD 105mm howitzers from the 11th marine regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with edson 's front line units .
late in the afternoon , edson stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying ,
you men have done a great job , and i have just CD more thing to ask of you .
hold out just CD more night .
i know we have been without sleep a long time .
but we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here .
i have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning .
edson 's speech raised the spirits of the raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead .
as the sun set on CD september , kawaguchi faced edson 's CD marines with CD CD troops of his brigade , plus an assortment of light artillery .
the night was pitch black , with no moon .
at CD CD , CD japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge .
kawaguchi 's attack began just after nightfall , with kokusho 's battalion assaulting raider company b on the marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge .
the force of the assault caused company b to fall back to hill CD .
under marine artillery fire , kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack .
without pausing to try to roll up the other nearby marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , kokusho 's unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the lunga river , heading for the airfield .
kokusho 's men came upon a pile of marine supplies and rations .
not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to gorge themselves on the c and k rations .
kokusho ordered his men to continue the attack .
at about CD CD , he led them against the marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as hill CD .
in the heavy fighting that followed , kokusho and around CD of his men were killed , ending that attack .
meanwhile , kawaguchi 's 2nd battalion , under major masao tamura , assembled for their planned assault against hill CD from the jungle south of the ridge .
marine observers spotted tamura 's preparations and called in artillery fire .
at about CD CD , a barrage from CD CD CD CD CD in guns hit tamura 's position .
in response , CD companies of tamura 's troops numbering about CD men charged up hill CD with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades .
tamura 's attack hit company b of the marine parachute battalion and also raider company b , pushing the parachutists off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the ridgeline .
to protect the exposed raider company b , edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto hill CD .
in the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized .
a few marines began yelling that the japanese were attacking with poison gas , scaring other marines who no longer possessed their gas masks .
after arriving behind hill CD , some of the marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word withdraw to anyone within earshot .
other marines began to follow them .
as the marines formed into a horseshoe shaped line around hill CD , tamura 's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from hill CD and up from below the east side of the ridge .
under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least CD japanese floatplane , the marines repulsed the first CD attacks by tamura 's men .
tamura 's troops hoisted a CD CD CD CD in regimental gun to the top of hill CD in an effort to fire it directly at the marines .
this gun , which could have turned the tide in favor of the japanese , however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin .
at midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , edson ordered parachute companies b and c to advance from behind hill CD to strengthen his left flank .
with fixed bayonets , the paramarines swept forward , killing japanese soldiers who had overrun the marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill .
marines from other units , as well as members of edson 's command staff , including major bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the marines around hill CD , who were running critically low .
said marine participant captain william j. mckennan , the japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that subsides for a moment and then pours the harder when CD wave was mowed down and i mean mowed down another followed it into death .
the japanese hit edson 's left flank just after the parachutists took position but were again stopped by marine rifle , machine gun , mortar , and grenade fire .
marine CD mm and CD CD artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking japanese .
a captured japanese soldier later said that his unit was annihilated by the marine artillery fire , which only CD of his company survived .
throughout the night , as kawaguchi 's men came close to overrunning the marine defenses , edson remained standing about CD yd CD m behind the marine firing line on hill CD , exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts .
said marine captain tex smith , who was in position to observe edson for most of the night , i can say that if there is such a thing as CD man holding a battalion together , edson did it that night .
he stood just behind the front lines stood , when most of us hugged the ground .
a counterattack by the marine engineers stopped CD japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat .
the other CD companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield .
when no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after daybreak .
most of the rest of watanabe 's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night .
as the sun rose on CD september , pockets of japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge .
but with tamura 's battalion shattered after losing of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , kawaguchi 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended .
about CD japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of hill CD , perhaps preparing for CD more charge on hill CD .
at first light , CD you.s. army aircraft from the 67th fighter squadron at henderson field , acting on a request personally delivered by bailey , strafed the japanese near hill CD and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle .
as the battle on the ridge took place , kawaguchi 's kuma and oka units also attacked the marine defenses on the east and west sides of the lunga perimeter .
the kuma battalion led by major takeshi mizuno attacked the southeastern sector of the lunga perimeter , defended by marines of the 3rd battalion , 1st marine regiment CD CD .
mizuno 's attack started around midnight , with CD company attacking through marine artillery fire and engaging in hand to hand combat with the marine defenders before being thrown back .
mizuno was killed in the attack .
after daybreak , the marines , believing that the rest of mizuno 's battalion was still in the area , sent forward CD light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the marine lines .
CD japanese CD CD CD CD in anti tank guns destroyed or disabled CD of them .
after abandoning their burning tanks , several of the disabled tanks crewmembers were bayoneted and killed by the japanese .
CD tank tumbled down an embankment into the tenaru river , drowning its crew .
at CD CD on CD september , the remnants of the kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the marine lines , but were repulsed .
a final weak attack by the kuma unit on the evening of CD september was also defeated .
oka 's unit of about CD men attacked the marines at several locations on the west side of the lunga perimeter .
at about CD CD on CD september , CD japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd battalion , 5th marine regiment 3 CD near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses .
another japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of CD september .
the rest of oka 's unit failed to find the marine lines and did not participate in the attack .
at CD CD on CD september , kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day .
kawaguchi 's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the matanikau river valley to join with oka 's unit , a CD CD CD CD km march over difficult terrain .
kawaguchi 's troops began the march on the morning of CD september .
almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded .
as the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles .
by the time most of them reached oka 's positions at kokumbona CD days later , only half still carried their weapons .
the kuma battalion 's survivors , attempting to follow kawaguchi 's center body forces , became lost , wandered for CD weeks in the jungle , and almost starved to death before finally reaching kawaguchi 's camp .
in total , kawaguchi 's forces lost about CD killed in the attack , including CD in tamura 's battalion , CD in kokusho 's battalion , CD in oka 's force , CD in the kuma battalion , and CD in watanabe 's battalion .
an unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the matanikau .
on and around the ridge , the marines counted CD japanese dead , including CD on the slopes of hill CD .
the marines suffered CD killed between CD and CD september .
on CD september , vandegrift sent CD companies from the 1st battalion , 1st marine regiment CD CD to pursue the retreating japanese .
the marines were ambushed by CD japanese companies acting as rear guards for the withdrawal , and CD marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the marines retreated .
the marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by vandegrift .
by nightfall , the japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing CD marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving .
on CD september , a patrol from edson 's raiders encountered stragglers from kawaguchi 's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed CD of them .
as the japanese regrouped west of the matanikau , the you.s. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their lunga defenses .
on CD september , vandegrift moved another battalion , the 3rd battalion , 2nd marine regiment CD CD , from tulagi to guadalcanal .
on CD september , an allied naval convoy delivered CD CD men from the 3rd provisional marine brigade the you.s. 7th marine regiment augmented by additional support units to guadalcanal .
these reinforcements allowed vandegrift beginning on CD september to establish an unbroken line of defense around the lunga perimeter .
vandegrift 's forces next significant clashes with the japanese occurred along the matanikau river from CD CD september and CD CD october .
on CD september , general hyakutake at rabaul learned of kawaguchi 's defeat , the imperial japanese army 's first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war .
the general forwarded the news to the imperial general headquarters in japan .
in an emergency session , the top japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war .
the results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on japanese operations in other areas of the pacific .
hyakutake realized that , in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the allied forces on guadalcanal , he could no longer support the major japanese offensive on the kokoda track in new guinea .
hyakutake with the concurrence of the general headquarters ordered his troops on new guinea , who were within CD CD CD km of their objective of port moresby to withdraw until the guadalcanal matter was resolved .
the japanese were never able to restart their drive towards port moresby .
the defeat at edson 's ridge contributed not only to japan 's defeat in the guadalcanal campaign , but also to japan 's ultimate defeat throughout the south pacific .
after delivering more forces during the next month the japanese mounted a major ground offensive on guadalcanal , led by hyakutake , in late october CD at the battle for henderson field , but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the japanese .
vandegrift later stated that kawaguchi 's assault on the ridge in september was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded , we would have been in a pretty bad condition .
historian richard b. frank adds , the japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in september CD , on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield , best known ever after as bloody ridge .
route CD is a state highway in the southern part of the you.s. state of new jersey .
it runs CD CD CD CD CD km from an intersection with you.s. route CD us CD and the garden state parkway in upper township , cape may county to an intersection with us CD and county route CD cr CD in egg harbor city , atlantic county .
the route , which is mostly a CD lane undivided road , passes through mostly rural areas of atlantic and cape may counties as well as the communities of tuckahoe , corbin city , estell manor , and mays landing .
nj CD intersects several roads , including route CD in tuckahoe , us CD in mays landing , and us CD and the atlantic city expressway in hamilton township .
the portion of current route CD between seaville and petersburg received funding in CD to become a spur of the ocean highway .
in CD , what is now route CD was designated a part of pre CD route CD , a route that was to run from cape may to egg harbor city .
route CD was designated onto its current alignment in CD , replacing this portion of pre CD route CD .
in CD , a freeway was proposed for route CD , running from the garden state parkway in dennis township to us CD in mullica township .
this proposal was canceled by the mid 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic .
the interchange between route CD and the atlantic city expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in june CD .
route CD begins at an intersection with us CD in the seaville section of upper township , cape may county , heading to the north on a CD lane undivided road .
from the southern terminus , a ramp provides access to and from the southbound garden state parkway .
the road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings .
it intersects cr CD in greenfield before coming to a junction with cr CD .
later , route CD cedar swamp creek in an area of marshland .
at this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a conrail shared assets operations railroad line before entering petersburg , where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a crossroad with cr CD .
upon leaving petersburg , route CD turns to the north again and crosses over the conrail shared assets operations railroad line , intersecting cr CD .
it continues to tuckahoe and comes to cr CD .
past this intersection , the route meets cr CD and cr CD .
route CD forms a concurrency with cr CD and the CD routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of route CD before leaving tuckahoe .
not far after route CD , the road crosses the tuckahoe river into corbin city , atlantic county .
in corbin city , it heads into residential areas , with cr CD looping to the west of the route .
route CD and cr CD continue northwest and intersect cr CD , where the road turns north into more forested areas .
at the junction with cr CD , the route turns to the northeast and enters estell manor , becoming broad street .
cr CD splits from route CD by heading northwest on buena tuckahoe road and route CD heads through some agricultural clearings concurrent with cr CD truck , passing to the west of the macnamara wildlife area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds .
the route intersects cr CD , turning to the northeast .
after passing some homes and stephen lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of estell manor county park .
the route crosses the south river into weymouth township , passing the residential community of belcoville to the east and meeting cr CD .
it soon enters hamilton township , where the name of the road becomes mill street and it comes to a junction with us CD harding highway .
cr CD truck heads to the west on us CD at this point while route CD heads east on us CD , and cr CD continues north .
us CD and nj CD follow the harding highway , a CD lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the great egg harbor river .
upon passing over the river , enters mays landing and turns north , encountering cr CD before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of mays landing .
here , the road crosses cr CD , and us CD splits from nj CD by turning east along that road .
meanwhile , route CD continues north on cape may avenue , passing through developed areas .
it leaves mays landing and heads into back into forests .
the route turns to the northeast , passing near the clover leaf lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with us CD black horse pike .
past this interchange , route CD widens to a CD lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the atlantic city expressway .
the route becomes a CD lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into galloway township , where there is an intersection with cr CD .
a short distance later , the road crosses new jersey transit s atlantic city line near the egg harbor city station and enters egg harbor city , turning into philadelphia avenue .
a block after the railroad crossing , route CD ends at an intersection with us CD and cr CD white horse pike , with cr CD continuing north on philadelphia avenue at this point .
route CD is an important route linking the atlantic city expressway with the jersey shore resorts in cape may county , serving as an alternate to more congested routes .
it also serves as evacuation route from cape may county to inland areas in the event of a hurricane .
the portion of current route CD between seaville and petersburg received funding to become a spur of the ocean highway in CD .
the modern day alignment of route CD was legislated as part of pre CD route CD in CD , a route that was to run from cape may to egg harbor city .
in the CD new jersey state highway renumbering , the portion of pre CD route CD between seaville and egg harbor city was designated as route CD , the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering .
route CD retained its current routing in the CD new jersey state highway renumbering .
a freeway was proposed for route CD around CD , running from the garden state parkway in dennis township north to us CD in mullica township .
this proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the jersey shore resorts of cape may county for travelers from the delaware valley .
however , this freeway was canceled by the mid 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along route CD .
on november CD , CD , construction began on making the interchange with the atlantic city expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the atlantic city expressway .
this project was completed on june CD , CD .
air rhodesia flight CD was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the zimbabwe people 's revolutionary army zipra on CD september CD , during the rhodesian bush war .
the aircraft involved , a vickers viscount named the hunyani , was flying the last leg of air rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from victoria falls to the capital salisbury , via the resort town of kariba .
soon after flight CD took off , a group of zipra guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a soviet made strela CD surface to air infrared homing missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing .
an attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of karoi was foiled by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up .
of the CD passengers and CD crew , CD died in this crash .
the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the CD survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire .
CD passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further CD lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived .
zipra leader joshua nkomo publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the hunyani in an interview with the bbc 's today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground .
the majority of rhodesians , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism .
a fierce white rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black rhodesians supported attacks of this kind .
reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the rhodesian government 's indignation .
talks between nkomo and prime minister ian smith , which had been progressing promisingly , were immediately suspended by the furious rhodesians , with smith calling nkomo a monster .
on CD september , smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas .
the rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over the following months , attacking both zipra and its rival , the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla .
the attack on zipra in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions .
CD months later , in february CD , zipra shot down air rhodesia flight CD , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident .
a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self governing colony of rhodesia or southern rhodesia led the colonial government , headed by prime minister ian smith , to unilaterally declare independence from the united kingdom on CD november CD .
the idea of no independence before majority rule had recently gained ground in britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and rhodesia 's government was dominated by the country 's white minority , so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally .
britain and the united nations imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia .
these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the second chimurenga against the rhodesian government and security forces .
the resulting conflict , the rhodesian bush war , began in earnest in december CD , when zanla attacked altena and whistlefield farms in north eastern rhodesia .
after the security forces mounted a successful counter insurgency campaign during CD and CD , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents favour .
the leftist carnation revolution of april CD caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support for smith 's administration , and led to mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with zanu .
around the same time , rhodesia 's other main backer , south africa , adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup .
following the abortive victoria falls conference of august CD , smith and the zapu leader joshua nkomo held unsuccessful talks between december CD and march CD .
zanu and zapu announced in october CD , during the run up to the unsuccessful geneva conference in december , that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint patriotic front .
in march CD , smith and non militant nationalist groups headed by bishop abel muzorewa , the reverend ndabaningi sithole and chief jeremiah chirau agreed what became the internal settlement .
this created a joint black white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia in june CD , pursuant to multiracial elections .
zanu and zapu were invited to participate , but refused .
nkomo sardonically dubbed smith 's black colleagues the blacksmiths .
zanu proclaimed CD to be the year of the people as the war continued .
officials from muzorewa 's united african national council , sent to the provinces to explain the internal settlement to rural blacks , were killed by marxist leninist guerrillas .
insurgents also began to target christian missionaries , climaxing in the killing of CD british missionaries and CD children at elim mission near the mozambican border on CD june .
the transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the internal settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control .
no country recognised rhodesia 's interim administration .
smith again worked to bring nkomo into the government , hoping this would lend it some credence domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat zanla .
starting on CD august CD , he attended secret meetings with nkomo in lusaka , zambia where zapu was based , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation lonrho .
attempts were made to also involve the zanu leader robert mugabe , but mugabe would have no part in the talks .
according to the south african military historian jakkie cilliers , negotiations between smith and nkomo progressed well and seemed on the verge of success by the start of september CD .
on CD september , smith and nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place .
rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about CD , in the latter stages of the war .
before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target .
the weapon that made such attacks feasible for zipra was the strela CD shoulder launched surface to air missile launcher , supplied by the soviet union from the mid 1970s as part of the warsaw pact 's materiel support .
by september CD , there had been CD reported attempts to shoot down rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful .
some rhodesian air force dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely .
no civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the bush war .
air rhodesia was the country 's national airline , established by the government on CD september CD to succeed central african airways , which was dissolved at the end of that year .
based at salisbury airport , air rhodesia 's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the south african cities of johannesburg and durban .
the flight CD aircraft was a vickers viscount 782d , a british made turboprop aircraft with CD engines on each wing .
it was named the hunyani after the river of the same name , which flowed between lake kariba and the rhodesian capital salisbury .
the hunyani was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between victoria falls and salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of kariba .
despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on kariba by zipra guerrillas on the northern side of the zambezi in zambia , the resort had endured as CD of rhodesia 's choice tourist destinations .
the flight on CD september CD , sunday afternoon , from kariba to salisbury carried CD crew members and CD passengers , most of whom were holidaymakers from salisbury , returning home after a weekend at the lake .
the flight took off from kariba airport on schedule soon after CD CD central africa time .
flight CD was piloted by CD year old captain john hood , a native of bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in CD .
he had flown viscounts for air rhodesia since CD , and had also served in the rhodesian air force on a voluntary basis .
his first officer , garth beaumont , was CD years old , and had lived in rhodesia for most of his life , having immigrated as a child from south africa .
the CD air stewardesses were dulcie esterhuizen , CD years old and from bulawayo , and CD year old louise pearson , from salisbury .
a group of zipra guerrillas , armed with a strela CD launcher , waited in the bush beneath flight CD 's flightpath , and fired on the hunyani about CD minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight .
the heat seeking missile hit the plane 's starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode .
a fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured , creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out .
the second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving hood with only his CD port engines .
heaving wildly , the hunyani began to descend rapidly .
at CD CD captain hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the CD starboard engines and was going to crash .
we are going in , he radioed .
telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the whamira hills , in the bush to the west of karoi , intending to belly land the craft .
the landing was relatively stable until the hunyani hit a previously unseen ditch , cartwheeled and exploded .
the remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin ablaze .
of the CD people on board , CD , including hood and beaumont , died in the crash .
CD survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage .
after briefly settling the others , CD of the passengers , dr cecil maclaren , led CD others young newlyweds robert and shannon hargreaves , mrs sharon coles , and her CD year old daughter tracey off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water .
the other CD remained close to the wreckage .
meanwhile , CD guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about CD CD .
CD of the CD survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching rhodesian army reservist anthony hill , CD , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman hans hansen and his wife diana did the same .
this left CD passengers in full view near the wreckage , including CD women and CD girls aged CD and CD .
the guerrillas , who were armed with ak CD rifles , presented themselves to the CD passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water .
they spoke in english , both to the survivors and among themselves .
they told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage .
when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able bodied men to carry the others .
the passengers were assembled into an area of about CD square metres CD sq ft .
standing roughly CD metres CD ft away , the cadres now raised their weapons .
you have taken our land , CD of them said .
please do not shoot us
CD of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire .
having collected water from the nearby village , maclaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots .
thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive .
this alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors .
CD of the guerrillas told maclaren 's group to come here .
the insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting maclaren and the others to flee .
hill and the hansens also ran .
they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge .
after hill and the others had hidden there for about CD hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about CD CD .
the guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site , filled their arms with various passengers belongings , then left again .
the survivors were found over the following days by the rhodesian army and police .
hill and mr and mrs hansen were taken to kariba hospital , while maclaren and his group were airlifted to andrew fleming hospital in salisbury .
nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the bbc 's today radio programme the next day , laughing as he did so , to the horror of most rhodesian observers , both black and white .
he said that he had received intelligence that the hunyani was being used for military purposes .
nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party 's policy to kill civilians , and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground .
by contrast , he said that his men had helped them , and had left them alive .
he also accused air rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government , an allegation that captain pat travers , air rhodesia 's general manager , called a downright , deliberate lie .
sibanda asserts that the massacre cannot be put beyond the scouts , and also supports nkomo 's claim that the hunyani had been used militarily , suggesting that zipra might have believed there to be rhodesian soldiers on board .
rhodesian television , before attacks on zanla in mozambique , had shown viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job , he writes , and zipra intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed at victoria falls .
a report published in the american magazine time a fortnight later described the incident as a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most alarming of rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true .
indeed , the white community in rhodesia heard the news with fury , and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism .
the prominent indian rhodesian gulab family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost CD members in the attack .
though rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the because of the crash , doing so only after CD days investigation , the truth was common knowledge in salisbury within hours .
smith wrote in his memoirs that the degree of anger was difficult to control .
white south africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared in the south african press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them .
a friends of rhodesia society in south africa offered a reward of r100,000 to anybody who would either kill nkomo or bring him to salisbury to stand trial .
geoffrey nyarota , who was then CD of the few black reporters at the rhodesia herald newspaper , later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general , believing them all to be terrorist sympathisers .
several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days .
according to the time article , a group of whites entered an unsegregated salisbury bar fingering the triggers of rifles and forced blacks drinking there to leave .
time also reported a rumour that CD white youths , on learning of the massacre , shot the first black man they saw .
smith says that several would be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists .
he instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress , and that it would not do to attack them .
many rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target .
at a memorial service held on CD september CD for flight CD 's passengers and crew at salisbury 's anglican cathedral , about CD CD people crowded inside , with another CD standing outside on the steps and pavement , many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets .
prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed air rhodesia and south african airways personnel , as well as rhodesian special air service soldiers and senior officers from other military units .
smith and several government ministers also attended , including p k van der byl , the co minister of foreign affairs .
dean john de costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a deafening silence from overseas .
nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the viscount , he said .
but are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised
we are not
like men in the story of the good samaritan , they pass by on the other side the ghastliness of this ill fated flight from kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come .
for others , far from our borders , it is an intellectual matter , not one which affects them deeply .
here is the tragedy
the talks between smith and the zapu leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by salisbury .
smith himself called nkomo a monster .
cilliers comments that the ending of the smith nkomo talks at this time was potentially the most serious result of the viscount massacre , as the talks had been progressing well before the incident .
he surmises that an agreement between the CD at this critical stage might have helped the transitional rhodesian government to secure international recognition .
on CD september , the prime minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law , which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed .
he declared rhodesia 's intent to liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism , and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for any defensive strikes we might undertake against guerrilla bases in their respective territories .
he claimed that the war had escalated because britain and the united states were supporting the patriotic front .
william irvine , the co minister of transport , warned the guerrillas that rhodesia w ould not let these innocents go unavenged .
because zapu and zipra were based in zambia , many rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country , but the first external target hit by the security forces following the viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of zanla bases around chimoio in mozambique .
the rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in november CD during operation dingo , destroying much of the zanla presence there , but the insurgents had since built a complex called new chimoio , slightly to the east .
the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals .
in a combined airborne ground assault called operation snoopy , the rhodesian air force , rhodesian light infantry and special air service wiped out much of new chimoio on CD september CD .
mozambique sent armour to zanla 's aid in the form of CD soviet made t CD tanks and CD russian btr CD armoured personnel carriers , but the former were routed and CD of the latter destroyed by the rhodesian security forces .
according to rhodesian figures , there were several CD guerrillas killed , while the security forces lost only CD soldiers , CD of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike .
rhodesia then attacked zipra 's bases in zambia , in what group captain peter petter bowyer later described as payback time for flight CD .
operation gatling , launched on CD october CD , was another joint force operation between the air force and the army , which contributed special air service and rhodesian light infantry paratroopers .
gatling 's primary target , just CD kilometres CD miles north east of central lusaka , was the formerly white owned westlands farm , which had been transformed into zipra 's main headquarters and training base under the name freedom camp .
zipra presumed that rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to lusaka .
about CD CD guerrillas underwent training at freedom camp , with senior zipra staff also on site .
the rhodesian operation 's other targets were chikumbi , CD kilometres CD miles north of lusaka , and mkushi camp .
all CD were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across zambia .
assaulting targets deep inside zambia was a first for the rhodesian forces .
previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked .
the zambians obeyed all of green leader 's instructions , made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic .
using rufunsa airstrip in eastern zambia as a forward base , the rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the CD day operation , and afterwards claimed to have killed over CD CD zipra personnel , as well as some cuban instructors .
historians paul moorcraft and peter mclaughlin write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of nkomo 's army , then numbering about CD CD fighters , had not been touched .
on the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had been killed in the rhodesian raid .
moorcraft and mclaughlin comment that for the rhodesian airmen , it would have been impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young zipra recruits .
sibanda describes freedom camp as a refugee camp for boys , and says CD boys and girls were killed .
he claims that the red cross and the un refugee agency confirmed zapu 's claim that smith 's forces struck at defenseless , civilian trainees .
the rhodesian attacks on zanla and zipra bases did much to restore white morale following the viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns .
nkomo and the zambian president kenneth kaunda all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the soviets and the british respectively .
martial law was quickly extended across rhodesia 's rural areas , and covered CD quarters of the country by the end of CD .
air rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti strela shielding for its viscounts .
before this work was completed , zipra shot down a second viscount , air rhodesia flight CD , on CD february CD .
this time there were no survivors .
following the second shootdown , air rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the viscounts would be coated with low radiation paint , with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded .
according to tests conducted by the air force , a viscount so treated could not be detected by the strela 's targeting system once it was over CD CD feet CD m .
there were no further viscount shootdowns in rhodesia .
in the elections held the following year under the internal settlement terms , boycotted by zanu and zapu , muzorewa won a majority , and became the first prime minister of the reconstituted , majority ruled state of zimbabwe rhodesia on CD june CD .
this new order failed to win international acceptance , however , and in december CD the lancaster house agreement was agreed in london by zimbabwe rhodesia , the uk government and the patriotic front , returning the country to its former colonial status .
the uk government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period .
fresh elections were won by mugabe , who took power in april CD , concurrently with the country 's recognised independence as zimbabwe .
in modern zimbabwe , it is not the viscount shootdowns but rather the retributory rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory .
state media in zimbabwe , prominently the herald newspaper , often claim that rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations .
zipra 's downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board .
the massacre of surviving flight CD passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than zipra .
in his CD memoirs nkomo repeated his claim that zipra fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that i truly have no idea how the ten died .
a monument to those killed in the rhodesian attack on chikumbi was built in zambia in CD , and dedicated jointly by the zambian and zimbabwean governments .
a memorial to the victims of the CD rhodesian viscount incidents , dubbed the viscount memorial , was erected on the grounds of the voortrekker monument in pretoria , south africa in CD , and inaugurated on CD september that year .
the names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on CD granite slabs that stand upright , side by side , the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft .
a pole beside the monument flies the rhodesian flag .
dumiso dabengwa , a former zipra commander , described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at lancaster house .
christopher mutsvangwa , a diplomat and political analyst , took a similar line , calling hoey 's proposed commemoration a provocation that means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle .
there is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country .
zapu 's official response to hoey 's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts civilians get caught up in cross fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors , and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the viscount shootdowns with those killed at chikumbi .
tikal tiˈkäl tik al in modern mayan orthography is the ruins of an ancient city found in a rainforest in guatemala .
ambrosio tut , a gum sapper , reported the ruins to la gaceta , a guatemalan newspaper , which named the site tikal .
after the berlin academy of sciences magazine republished the report in CD , archeologists and treasure hunters began visiting the forest .
today tourism to the site may help protect the rainforest .
it is CD of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre columbian maya civilization .
it is located in the archaeological region of the petén basin in what is now northern guatemala .
situated in the department of el petén , the site is part of guatemala 's tikal national park and in CD it was declared a unesco world heritage site .
tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became CD of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient maya .
though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century because , tikal reached its apogee during the classic period , c .
CD to CD ad .
during this time , the city dominated much of the maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico .
there is evidence that tikal was conquered by teotihuacan in the 4th century ad .
following the end of the late classic period , no new major monuments were built at tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned .
these events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site s abandonment by the end of the 10th century .
tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces .
the name tikal may be derived from ti ak'al in the yucatec maya language .
it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning at the waterhole .
the name was apparently applied to CD of the site 's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region .
it has alternatively been interpreted as meaning the place of the voices in the itza maya language .
tikal , however , is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the CD .
hieroglyphic inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as yax mutal or yax mutul , meaning first mutal .
tikal may have come to have been called this because dos pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph .
the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name .
the kingdom as a whole was simply called mutul , which is the reading of the hair bundle emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo .
its precise meaning remains obscure .
the closest large modern settlements are flores and santa elena , approximately CD kilometres CD CD by road to the southwest .
tikal is approximately CD kilometres CD CD north of guatemala city .
it is CD kilometres CD CD south of the contemporary maya city of uaxactun and CD kilometres CD CD northwest of yaxha .
the city was located CD kilometres CD mi southeast of its great classic period rival , calakmul , and CD kilometres CD CD northwest of calakmul 's ally caracol , now in belize .
the city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than CD square kilometres CD CD sq mi that included about CD CD structures .
the topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands .
the major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised causeways spanning the swamps .
the area around tikal has been declared as the tikal national park and the preserved area covers CD square kilometres CD sq mi .
the ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern guatemala that formed the cradle of lowland maya civilization .
the city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east west trade route across the yucatan peninsula .
conspicuous trees at the tikal park include gigantic kapok ceiba pentandra the sacred tree of the maya .
tropical cedar cedrela odorata , and honduras mahogany swietenia macrophylla .
regarding the fauna , agouti , white nosed coatis , gray foxes , geoffroy 's spider monkeys , howler monkeys , harpy eagles , falcons , ocellated turkeys , guans , toucans , green parrots and leafcutter ants can be seen there regularly .
jaguars , jaguarundis , and cougars are also said to roam in the park .
for centuries this city was completely covered under jungle .
the average annual rainfall at tikal is CD CD millimetres CD CD in .
CD of the largest of the classic maya cities , tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in CD reservoirs .
archaeologists working in tikal during the 20th century refurbished CD of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use .
the tikal national park covers an area of CD CD square kilometres CD CD sq mi .
it was created on CD may CD under the auspices of the instituto de antropología e historia and was the first protected area in guatemala .
population estimates for tikal vary from CD CD to as high as CD CD inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range .
the population of tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the preclassic period approximately CD because ad CD , with a peak in the late classic with the population growing rapidly from ad CD through to CD , followed by a sharp decline .
for the CD square kilometres CD sq mi area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at CD per square kilometer CD per square mile .
in an area within a CD kilometres CD CD CD radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at CD CD .
population density is estimated at CD per square kilometer CD per square mile .
in a region within a CD kilometres CD mi radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at CD CD with a density of CD per square kilometer CD per square mile .
these population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture .
however , some archaeologists , such as david webster , believe these figures to be far too high .
the dynastic line of tikal , founded as early as the 1st century ad , spanned CD years and included at least CD rulers .
there are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as CD because , in the middle preclassic .
a cache of mamon ceramics dating from about CD CD because were found in a sealed chultun , a subterranean bottle shaped chamber .
major construction at tikal was already taking place in the late preclassic period , first appearing around CD CD because , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as el mirador and nakbe .
at this time , tikal participated in the widespread chikanel culture that dominated the central and northern maya areas at this time a region that included the entire yucatan peninsula including northern and eastern guatemala and all of belize .
CD temples dating to late chikanel times had masonry walled superstructures that may have been corbel vaulted , although this has not been proven .
CD of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a scrollwork background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red .
in the 1st century ad rich burials first appeared and tikal underwent a political and cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined .
at the end of the late preclassic , the izapan style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence tikal , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city .
dynastic rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted at tikal .
according to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by yax moch xoc , perhaps in the 3rd century ad .
at the beginning of the early classic , power in the maya region was concentrated at tikal and calakmul , in the core of the maya heartland .
tikal may have benefited from the collapse of the large preclassic states such as el mirador .
in the early classic tikal rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the maya region , stimulating the development of other nearby maya cities .
the site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of alliances and conflict with other maya states , including uaxactun , caracol , naranjo and calakmul .
the site was defeated at the end of the early classic by caracol , which rose to take tikal 's place as the paramount center in the southern maya lowlands .
the earlier part of the early classic saw hostilities between tikal and its neighbor uaxactun , with uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from tikal .
there appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by ad CD , when lady unen bahlam conducted a katun ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city .
the fourteenth king of tikal was chak tok ich'aak great jaguar paw .
chak tok ich'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the central acropolis .
little is known about chak tok ich'aak except that he was killed on CD january CD ad .
on the same day , siyah k ak fire is born arrived from the west , having passed through el peru , a site to the west of tikal , on CD january .
on stela CD he is named as lord of the west .
siyah k ak was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico .
spearthrower owl may even have been the ruler of teotihuacan .
these recorded events strongly suggest that siyah k ak led a teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native tikal king , who was captured and immediately executed .
siyah k'ak appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at tikal itself .
roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the lost world complex .
he also exerted control over other cities in the area , including uaxactun , where he became king , but did not take the throne of tikal for himself .
within a year , the son of spearthrower owl by the name of yax nuun ayiin i first crocodile had been installed as the tenth king of tikal while he was still a boy , being enthroned on CD september CD .
he reigned for CD years as king of tikal , and remained a vassal of siyah k'ak for as long as the latter lived .
it seems likely that yax nuun ayiin i took a wife from the preexisting , defeated , tikal dynasty and thus legitimized the right to rule of his son , siyaj chan k'awiil ii .
although the new rulers of tikal were foreign , their descendants were rapidly mayanized .
tikal became the key ally and trading partner of teotihuacan in the maya lowlands .
after being conquered by teotihuacan , tikal rapidly dominated the northern and eastern peten .
uaxactun , together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into tikal 's kingdom .
other sites , such as bejucal and motul de san josé near lake petén itzá became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north .
by the middle of the 5th century tikal had a core territory of at least CD kilometres CD mi in every direction .
around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of tikal 's hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city .
additional fortifications were probably also built to the south .
these defenses protected tikal 's core population and agricultural resources , encircling an area of approximately CD square kilometres CD sq mi .
recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose .
in the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as copán , whose founder k'inich yax k'uk mo was clearly connected with tikal .
copán itself was not in an ethnically maya region and the founding of the copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of tikal .
k'inich yax k'uk mo arrived in copán in december CD and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at tikal .
an individual known as ajaw k'uk mo lord k'uk mo is referred to in an early text at tikal and may well be the same person .
his tomb had teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of teotihuacan .
hieroglyphic texts refer to him as lord of the west , much like siyah k ak .
at the same time , in late CD , copán founded the nearby site of quiriguá , possibly sponsored by tikal itself .
the founding of these CD centers may have been part of an effort to impose tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the maya region .
the interaction between these sites and tikal was intense over the next CD centuries .
a long running rivalry between tikal and calakmul began in the 6th century , with each of the CD cities forming its own network of mutually hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has been likened to a long running war between CD maya superpowers .
the kings of these CD capitals adopted the title kaloomte , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to high king .
the early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the lady of tikal , who was very likely a daughter of chak tok ich'aak ii .
she seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co rulers .
the first of these was kaloomte b'alam , who seems to have had a long career as a general at tikal before becoming co ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence .
the lady of tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering .
it appears she was later paired with lord bird claw , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler .
.
in the mid 6th century , caracol seems to have allied with calakmul and defeated tikal , closing the early classic .
the tikal hiatus refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large scale construction at tikal .
in the latter half of the 6th century ad , a serious crisis befell the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture .
the badly eroded altar CD at caracol described how tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in april CD .
it seems that caracol was an ally of calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and tikal , with the defeat of tikal having a lasting impact upon the city .
tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken .
after its great victory , caracol grew rapidly and some of tikal 's population may have been forcibly relocated there .
during the hiatus period , at least CD ruler of tikal took refuge with janaab pakal of palenque , another of calakmul 's victims .
calakmul itself thrived during tikal 's long hiatus period .
the beginning of the tikal hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly subdivide the classic period of mesoamerican chronology into the early and late classic .
in CD tikal founded dos pilas , some CD kilometres CD CD to the southwest , as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the pasión river .
b'alaj chan k'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of CD , in CD , and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother , the king of tikal .
roughly CD years later dos pilas was attacked by calakmul and was soundly defeated .
the first CD rulers of dos pilas continued to use the mutal emblem glyph of tikal , and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of tikal itself .
for some reason , b'alaj chan k'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of tikal .
instead he stayed at dos pilas .
tikal counterattacked against dos pilas in CD , driving b'alaj chan k'awiil into an exile that lasted CD years .
calakmul tried to encircle tikal within an area dominated by its allies , such as el peru , dos pilas and caracol .
in CD , jasaw chan k'awiil i erected the first dated monument at tikal in CD years and claimed the title of kaloomte , so ending the hiatus .
he initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on calakmul when , in CD , he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered .
after this , calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory .
by the 7th century , there was no active teotihuacan presence at any maya site and the center of teotihuacan had been razed by CD .
even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was teotihuacan style .
jasaw chan k'awiil i and his heir yik'in chan k'awiil continued hostilities against calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around tikal , extending as far as the territory around lake petén itzá .
these CD rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today .
in CD , quiriguá , a vassal of copán , tikal 's key ally in the south , switched allegiance to calakmul , defeated copán and gained its own independence .
it appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of calakmul to bring about the collapse of tikal 's southern allies .
this upset the balance of power in the southern maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of copán .
in the 8th century , the rulers of tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the north acropolis .
by the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at tikal slowed .
impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers .
by the 9th century , the crisis of the classic maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence .
increasingly endemic warfare in the maya region caused tikal 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline .
construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the erection of temple CD , the last of the city 's major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th k'atun in CD .
the beginning of the 10th bak'tun in CD passed uncelebrated , and marks the beginning of a CD year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city .
during this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under tikal 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the mutal emblem glyph , with tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence .
in CD , jewel k'awiil is mentioned on a stela at seibal as visiting that city as the divine lord of tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and tikal 's once great power was little more than a memory .
the sites of ixlu and jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive mutal emblem glyph .
as tikal and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered deforestation , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels .
tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from CD to CD and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly .
there is not much evidence from tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the maya region during the terminal classic , although an influx of refugees from the petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources .
in the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of tikal , as evidenced by a stela erected in the great plaza by jasaw chan k'awiil ii in CD .
this was the last monument erected at tikal before the city finally fell into silence .
the former satellites of tikal , such as jimbal and uaxactun , did not last much longer , erecting their final monuments in CD .
by the end of the 9th century the vast majority of tikal 's population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial plazas .
the squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non utilitarian items such as musical instruments .
these inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them .
some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations .
before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the north acropolis being explored for jade and the easier to find tombs being looted .
after CD , tikal was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins .
even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next CD years .
some of tikal 's population may have migrated to the peten lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century .
the most likely because of collapse at tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure .
the fall of tikal was a blow to the heart of classic maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a CD years , with an ancient ruling dynasty .
however , new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of tikal .
in CD , the spanish conquistador hernán cortés passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of tikal but did not mention them in his letters .
after spanish friar andrés de avendaño became lost in the petén forests in early CD he described a ruin that may well have been tikal .
as is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region .
it seems that local people never forgot about tikal and they guided guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the CD .
because of the site 's remoteness from modern towns , however , no explorers visited tikal until modesto méndez and ambrosio tut , respectively the commissioner and the governor of petén , visited it in CD .
artist eusebio lara accompanied them and their account was published in germany in CD .
several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and photograph tikal in the 19th century including alfred p. maudslay in CD CD and the early 20th century .
pioneering archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the 1880s .
in CD , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days travel through the jungle on foot or mule .
in CD the tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the maya area .
from CD through CD , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the university of pennsylvania tikal project .
they mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures .
excavations directed by edwin m. shook and later by william coe of the university investigated the north acropolis and the central plaza from CD to CD .
the tikal project recorded over CD monuments at the site .
in CD , the guatemalan government began a further archeological project at tikal , which continued through to CD .
filmmaker george lucas used tikal as a filming location for the first star wars film , episode iv a new hope , released in CD .
temple i at tikal was featured on the reverse of the CD centavo banknote .
tikal is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park .
a site museum has been built at tikal .
it was completed in CD .
tikal has been partially restored by the university of pennsylvania and the government of guatemala .
it was CD of the largest of the classic period maya cities and was CD of the largest cities in the americas .
the architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over CD metres CD ft high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments .
there is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors .
there are also CD courts for playing the mesoamerican ballgame , including a set of CD in the CD temples plaza , a unique feature in mesoamerica .
the limestone used for construction was local and quarried on site .
the depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs , together with some waterproofed natural depressions .
the main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs .
the residential area of tikal covers an estimated CD square kilometres CD sq mi , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated .
a huge set of earthworks discovered by dennis e. puleston and donald callender in the 1960s rings tikal with a CD metre CD ft wide trench behind a rampart .
the CD square kilometres CD CD sq mi area around the site core has been intensively mapped .
it may have enclosed an area of some CD square kilometres CD sq mi see below .
population estimates place the demographic size of the site between CD CD and CD CD , and possibly CD CD in the surrounding area .
recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is inconsequential as a defensive feature .
in addition , some parts of the earthwork were integrated into a canal system .
the earthwork of tikal varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and multifaceted than originally thought .
by the late classic , a network of sacbeob causeways linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core .
these linked the great plaza with temple CD located about CD metres CD CD ft to the west and the temple of the inscriptions about CD kilometre CD CD mi to the southeast .
these broad causeways were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists .
the maler , maudslay , tozzer and méndez causeways .
they assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams .
the maler causeway runs north from behind temple i to group h. a large bas relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of group h. it depicts CD bound captives and dates to the late classic .
the maudsley causeway runs CD CD kilometres CD CD CD northeast from temple iv to group h.
the mendez causeway runs southeast from the east plaza to temple vi , a distance of about CD CD kilometres CD CD mi .
the tozzer causeway runs west from the great plaza to temple iv .
the great plaza lies at the core of the site .
it is flanked on the east and west sides by CD great temple pyramids .
on the north side it is bordered by the north acropolis and on the south by the central acropolis .
the central acropolis is a palace complex just south of the great plaza .
the north acropolis , together with the great plaza immediately to the south , is CD of the most studied architectural groups in the maya area .
the tikal project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history .
it is a complex group with construction beginning in the preclassic period , around CD because .
it developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the classic period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures .
after ad CD a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier northern platform , which measured CD by CD metres CD by CD ft , gradually hiding it from view .
CD temple pyramids were built in the 6th century ad , each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods .
by the 9th century ad , CD stelae and CD altars had been erected in the north acropolis .
CD of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits .
the north acropolis continued to receive burials into the postclassic period .
the south acropolis is found next to temple v. it was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than CD CD square metres CD CD sq ft .
the plaza of the seven temples is to the west of the south acropolis .
it is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side .
the mundo perdido is to the west of the plaza of the seven temples .
it is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the preclassic period at tikal .
the complex was organized as a large e group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported CD temples .
the mundo perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history .
by ad CD CD its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the valley of mexico , including the use of the talud tablero form .
during the early classic period c .
CD CD the mundo perdido became CD of the twin foci of the city , the other being the north acropolis .
from ad CD to CD it may have served as the royal necropolis .
the mundo perdido complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the university of pennsylvania .
it is centered upon the lost world pyramid and a small platform to the west of it .
group g lies just south of the mendez causeway .
the complex dates to the late classic and consists of palace type structures and is CD of the largest groups of its type at tikal .
it has CD stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of CD vaulted chambers .
the remains of CD further chambers belong to the upper storey .
CD of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask .
group h is centered on a large plaza to the north of the great plaza .
it is bordered by temples dating to the late classic .
there are CD twin pyramid complexes at tikal , CD of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed .
they vary in size but consist of CD pyramids facing each other on an east west axis .
these pyramids are flat topped and have stairways on all CD sides .
a row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly equidistant from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair .
on the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with CD doorways .
the entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at CD year or k'atun intervals during the late classic .
the first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the east plaza .
it was once thought that these complexes were unique to tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as yaxha and ixlu , and they may reflect the extent of tikal 's political dominance in the late classic .
group q is a twin pyramid complex , and is CD of the largest at tikal .
it was built by yax nuun ayiin ii in CD in order to mark the end of the 17th k'atun .
most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re erected .
group r is another twin pyramid complex , dated to CD .
it is close to the maler causeway .
there are thousands of ancient structures at tikal and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work .
the most prominent surviving buildings include CD very large pyramids , labelled temples i vi , each of which support a temple structure on their summits .
some of these pyramids are over CD metres CD feet high .
they were numbered sequentially during the early survey of the site .
it is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as CD years .
temple i also known as the temple of ah cacao or temple of the great jaguar is a funerary pyramid dedicated to jasaw chan k'awil , who was entombed in the structure in ad CD , the pyramid was completed around CD CD .
the temple rises CD metres CD ft high .
the massive roofcomb that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this decoration survives .
the tomb of the king was discovered by aubrey trik of the university of pennsylvania in CD .
the shrine at the summit of the pyramid has CD chambers , each behind the next , with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from multiple beams .
the outermost lintel is plain but the CD inner lintels were carved , some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to museums in europe .
temple ii also known as the temple of the mask it was built around ad CD and stands CD metres CD ft high .
like other major temples at tikal , the summit shrine had CD consecutive chambers with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels , only the middle of which was carved .
the temple was dedicated to the wife of jasaw chan k'awil , although no tomb was found .
the queen 's portrait was carved into the lintel spanning the doorway of the summit shrine .
CD of the beams from this lintel is now in the american museum of natural history in new york .
temple iii also known as the temple of the jaguar priest was the last of the great pyramids to be built at tikal .
it stood CD metres CD ft tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof lintel , possibly showing dark sun engaged in a ritual dance around ad CD .
the temple shrine possesses CD chambers .
temple iv is the tallest temple pyramid at tikal , measuring CD metres CD ft from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb .
temple v stands south of the central acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler .
the temple stands CD metres CD ft high , making it the second tallest structure at tikal only temple iv is taller .
the temple has been dated to about ad CD , in the late classic period , via radiocarbon analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of nun bak chak in the second half of the 7th century .
temple vi is also known as the temple of the inscriptions and was dedicated in ad CD .
it is notable for its CD metre CD ft high roof comb .
panels of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof comb .
the temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is unrestored .
temple CD was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of siyaj chan k'awiil i known as burial CD in the north acropolis .
it started life in the early classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway .
later in the early classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels .
during the hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure burial CD .
while the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb burial CD was inserted into the rubble core of the building .
the pyramid was then completed , standing CD metres CD ft tall .
the final version of temple CD was completely dismantled by archaeologists in CD in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction .
structure CD is a pyramid in the north acropolis that was built by siyaj chan k'awiil ii over the tomb of his father , yax nuun ayiin i. the pyramid was topped by a CD chambered shrine , the rooms situated CD behind the other .
structure 5d CD is an unusual radial temple in the east plaza , built over a pre existing twin pyramid complex .
it is built into the end of the east plaza ballcourt and possessed CD entry doorways and CD stairways , the fourth south side was too close to the central acropolis for a stairway on that side .
the building has a talud tablero platform profile , modified from the original style found at teotihuacan .
in fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with el tajin and xochicalco than with teotihuacan itself .
the vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols .
large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels , related to the venus and star symbols used at teotihuacan .
the roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth .
the second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake .
the temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of nuun ujol chaak or that of his son jasaw chan k'awiil i , in the later part of the 7th century .
structure 5c CD possesses a clear teotihuacan linked architectural style .

it had stairways on all CD sides and did not possess a superstructure .
the lost world pyramid structure 5c CD is the largest structure in the mundo perdido complex .
it lies in the southwest portion of tikal s central core , south of temple iii and west of temple v. it was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the late preclassic .
this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un impacted by later building activity at tikal .
by the end of the late preclassic this pyramid was CD of the largest structures in the maya region .
it attained its final form during the reign of chak tok ich'aak in the 4th century ad , in the early classic , standing more than CD metres CD ft high with stairways on all CD sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from perishable materials .
although the plaza later suffered significant alteration , the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex adheres to the layout that defines the so called e groups , identified as solar observatories .

tropical storm josephine was the tenth tropical storm of the CD atlantic hurricane season .
josephine developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the african coast on august CD .
the wave quickly became organized and was declared tropical depression ten while located CD CD CD km to the south southeast of the cape verde islands on september CD .
the depression was quickly upgraded to tropical storm josephine around noon the same day .
over the next several days , josephine moved in a general west northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on september CD .
strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of hurricane ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken .
on september CD , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused josephine to weaken into a tropical depression .
josephine deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm .
the low ultimately dissipated while located CD CD CD km east of guadeloupe on september CD .
however , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of st. croix .
tropical storm josephine formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of africa near the end of august CD .
it tracked south of cape verde and slowly developed , and on september CD the disturbance became tropical depression ten while located south southeast of the cape verde islands .
as the depression became more organized , an eye like feature developed in the upper levels of the system .
the depression was upgraded to tropical storm josephine CD hours after forming .
josephine was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly .
josephine continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical .
however , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the national hurricane center was uncertain of its actual intensity .
despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification .
the storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper level trough diving southward .
despite convection being partially removed from the center of josephine , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on september CD as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized .
the intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger .
josephine reached its peak intensity of CD mph CD km h around CD a.m. edt as it continued to become more organized .
however , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken .
outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system .
during the afternoon hours , the structure of josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll .
by the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center .
despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of josephine .
the center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity .
the forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the CD day forecast was predicted .
however , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and josephine weakened again .
by the afternoon , the center of josephine was only a swirl of clouds , devoid of convection .
during the overnight hours on september CD into the morning of september CD , convection associated with josephine began to redevelop somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong southerly wind shear .
by mid morning , josephine re intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection .
however , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on josephine by late morning .
the convection around the system became dislocated from the center and josephine weakened slightly .
the weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong southerly shear .
josephine became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid afternoon and the storm weakened to CD mph CD km h , barely holding on to tropical storm status .
josephine regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm .
due to the lack of convection , josephine was downgraded to a tropical depression at 11p.m. edt with winds of CD mph CD km h .
since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression .
the next morning , josephine was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm .
no redevelopment was expected with josephine as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated .
however , the remnant low associated with josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on september CD .
convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed .
on september CD , wind shear took over the system again .
convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more .
the national hurricane center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed .
finally , on september CD , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of josephine deteriorating into an open wave .
however , on september CD , the remnants of josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system .
once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of josephine headed towards the bahamas .
however , on september CD , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely .
as josephine passed to the south of the cape verde islands on september CD , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around CD CD inches CD mm .
there were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor .
several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from josephine brought showers and thunderstorms to st. croix where up to CD in CD CD mm of rain fell .
the heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding .
no known damage was caused by the flood .
mount elbert is the highest summit of the rocky mountains of north america and the highest point in the you.s. state of colorado and the entire mississippi river drainage basin .
the ultra prominent CD CD foot CD CD m fourteener is the highest peak in the sawatch range and the second highest summit in the contiguous united states after mount whitney .
mount elbert is located in san isabel national forest , CD CD miles CD CD km southwest bearing CD of the city of leadville in lake county , colorado .
the mountain was named in honor of colorado statesman samuel hitt elbert , who was active in the formative period of the state and governor of the territory of colorado from CD to CD .
henry w. stuckle of the hayden survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in CD .
the easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as class CD to CD or a in mountaineering parlance .
mount elbert is therefore often referred to as the gentle giant that tops all others in the rocky mountains .
mount elbert is visible to the southwest of leadville , often snow capped even in the summer .
many other fourteeners surround elbert in all directions , and it is very close to central colorado 's collegiate peaks .
the neighboring mount massive , to the north , is the second highest peak in the rocky mountains and the third highest in the contiguous united states , and la plata peak , to the south , is the fifth highest in the rockies .
the community of twin lakes lies at the base of mount elbert , denver is about CD miles CD km to the east , vail is CD miles CD km to the north , and aspen is CD miles CD km to the west .
leadville , about CD miles CD km to the northeast , is the nearest large town .
elbert 's parent peak is mount whitney in california .
including alaska and hawaii , mount elbert is the fourteenth highest mountain in the united states .
weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime .
hailstorms and snow are possible year round .
an electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the july CD issue of science .
mount elbert is part of the sawatch range , an uplift of the laramide orogeny which separated from the mosquito range to the east around CD CD years ago .
the tops of this range were heavily glaciated , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues .
for example , the base of elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded , which lie on a lateral moraine .
further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn .
there are also lakes to both the north and south , turquoise and twin lakes respectively .
the twin lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and turquoise lake was created by the manmade sugar loaf dam .
mount elbert is composed largely of quartzite .
however , the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock , which is pre cambrian in origin and about CD CD CD years old .
there are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite , as well as bands of gneiss and schist .
unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere , elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north facing cirque , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation .
the first recorded ascent of the peak was by h.w. stuckle in CD , who was surveying the mountain as part of the hayden survey .
originally measured as CD CD feet CD CD m in height , mount elbert 's elevation was later adjusted to CD CD feet CD CD m following a re evaluation of mapped elevations , which sparked protests .
the actual change was made in CD as a result of the north american vertical datum of CD .
it seems the original measurement resulted from the sea level datum of CD .
a matter of some contention arose after the great depression over the heights of elbert and its neighbor , mount massive , which differ in elevation by only CD feet CD CD m .
this led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the mount massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the mount elbert proponents demolish them .
the effort was ultimately unsuccessful and mount elbert has remained the highest peak in colorado .
the first motorized ascent of elbert occurred in CD , when a jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development .
the summit of mount elbert is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as phacelia sericea sky pilot , hymenoxys grandiflora old man of the mountain , and geum rossii alpine avens .
also noted are carex atrata var. pullata , salix desertorum , platanthera hyperborea , thalictrum fendleri , aquilegia canadensis , chenopodium album , gentiana detonsa var. hallii , and bigelovia parryi .
below treeline the mountain is heavily forested , with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine , spruce , aspen and fir .
some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears , marmots , mule deer , pikas , and pocket gophers .
there are also many species of avifauna .
elk , grouse , turkey and bighorn sheep are present in the area during the summer .
there are CD main routes which ascend the mountain , all of which gain over CD CD feet CD CD m of elevation .
the standard route ascends the peak from the east , starting from the colorado trail just north of twin lakes .
the CD CD miles CD CD km long north main elbert trail begins close to the elbert creek campground , and gains about CD CD feet CD CD m .
the trail is open to equestrians , mountain bikers and hunters during season .
an easier , but longer route , the south elbert trail , is CD CD miles CD CD km long , climbing CD CD feet CD CD m at a less punishing gradient than the north elbert trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge .
even healthy and experienced climbers report great difficulty on this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky in places .
the elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the CD CD mile ascent .
there are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from south halfmoon creek trailhead and echo canyon trailhead respectively .
although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing .
the main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness .
this can affect anyone , even those who are acclimatized .
in serious cases , it can lead to high altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , paralysis , and death .
climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before CD a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes .
although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking , anna elizabeth dickinson , the orator , ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the you.s. government .
the church of scientology has been present in germany since CD .
german authorities estimate that there are CD CD active scientologists in germany today .
the church of scientology gives a membership figure of around CD CD .
the church of scientology has encountered particular antagonism from the german press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in germany .
german courts have so far not resolved whether scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or worldview community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions .
the german domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities .
the german government does not recognize scientology as a religion .
it views it as an abusive business masquerading as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the german constitution .
this stance has been criticized , most notably by the you.s. government , which recognizes scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters .
scientologists in germany face specific political and economic restrictions .
they are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so called sect filters to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization .
german federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning scientology in late CD , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds .
despite this , polls suggest that most germans favor banning scientology altogether .
scientology , founded in the early 1950s in the united states by l. ron hubbard and today claiming to be represented in CD countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement .
its stated utopian aim is to clear the planet , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations .
scientology teaches that the source of people 's unhappiness lies in engrams , psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of counselling called auditing made available by the church of scientology .
the fact that scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other scientology services has brought controversy to scientology throughout much of its history , with governments classing it as a profit making enterprise rather than as a religion .
critics maintain that scientology is a business driven , psychologically manipulative , totalitarian ideology with world dominating aspirations , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for scientology courses .
scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion .
the german government has said that it does not consider scientology a religion , but a commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism whose totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to germany 's democratic society .
accordingly , the german government has taken a very strong stance against the organization .
germany is not alone in opposing scientology .
in france , the church of scientology was convicted of organized fraud in october CD , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for scientology products , and the church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether .
scientology is similarly controversial in belgium , greece and the uk .
on the subject of scientology 's status as a religion , the german government has pointed to a CD decision by the federal labor court of germany .
that court , noting hubbard 's instruction that scientologists should make money , make more money make other people produce so as to make more money , came to the conclusion that scientology purports to be a church merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests .
in the same decision , the court also found that scientology uses inhuman and totalitarian practices .
given the lessons of germany 's 20th century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power .
references in scientology writings to the elimination of parasites and antisocial people who stand in the way of progress towards scientology 's utopian world without insanity , without criminals and without war evoke uncomfortable parallels with nazism , and have led to scientology being classified as an extremist political movement .
in examining the potential threat posed by scientology the german government has noted that scientology organizations are structured so as to make the individual psychologically and financially dependent on a scientology system , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family .
scientology first became active in germany in CD .
by CD , there were CD major centres scientology churches , as well as CD minor centres scientology missions in germany .
the german scientology churches are located in the big cities munich , hamburg , berlin , düsseldorf , frankfurt am main , hanover and stuttgart .
of the scientology missions , CD are in baden württemberg , and CD in bavaria .
following german re unification , scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former german democratic republic .
most adherents are found in baden württemberg , bavaria and north rhine westphalia .
scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or vereine in germany .
their umbrella organisation is the scientology kirche deutschland e.v. germany 's domestic intelligence service , the bundesamt für verfassungsschutz bfv , or federal office for the protection of the constitution , estimates that there are CD CD scientologists in germany , down from earlier estimates of CD CD to CD CD .
the church of scientology reported around CD CD members from the mid 1990s onwards .
this number remained stable for many years .
however more recently scientology has said it has only CD CD members .
discrepancies in scientology membership numbers arise because the church of scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement .
the number of contractually bound scientology staff members working in german scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few CD .
scientology formulated a clear germany strategy in CD similar to equivalent strategies pursued by scientology in other countries and regions of the world with the long term aim of transforming german society in line with the scientological ideal a non pluralist society in which scientology enjoys overriding influence .
as most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in .
however , according to the bfv , the strategy has not had any significant success .
by CD , CD government officials had been suspected of being scientologists and in CD cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise scientology .
according to fifka sydora CD , it is unknown to what degree the clear germany programme is still being pursued .
german public discourse does not regard scientology as a religion , but generally characterizes it as a sekte cult or sect , or as an exploitative profit making venture preying on vulnerable minds .
public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about youth religions such as the unification church , iskcon , children of god , and the divine light mission .
the most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the sect commissioners sektenbeauftragte of germany 's protestant churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private initiatives of parents and concerned persons .
aktion bildungsinformation educational information campaign became an important organization dedicated to opposing scientology .
taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the church of scientology over its proselytizing in public places , and published an influential book , the sect of scientology and its front organizations .
in CD , the organization 's founder , ingo heinemann , became the director of aktion für geistige und psychische freiheit campaign for intellectual and psychic freedom , germany 's most prominent anti cult organization .
warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation .
as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects , the earliest of these publications appearing in CD .
from the mid 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays on scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience .
as noted by the religious scholar hubert seiwert , scientology came to be seen as a serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state .
this view of scientology as a public enemy , seiwert adds , became a matter of political correctness senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism .
stephen a. kent , writing in CD , noted that officials at all levels of german government shared the insistence that scientology should be suppressed .
scientology was viewed as a totalitarian , business driven organization guilty of significant human rights abuses .
officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was antithetical to a democratic state .
federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of scientology .
government publications on the dangers of sects increased between CD and CD , and a significant number of them dealt with the church of scientology .
the german courts had approved such publications in CD , seeing them as part of the government 's responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom .
in CD , the german parliament launched an enquete enquiry commission to investigate sects and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about scientology .
its final report , published in june CD , concluded that scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by germany 's domestic intelligence services .
an area of widespread concern in the german media has been the alleged infiltration of businesses by scientologists , in line with scientology 's declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in preparation for world domination .
attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management training companies .
management consultancy firms led by scientologists often conceal their association with scientology .
once they have recruited members of their clients upper management , these managers may send employees to scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used .
an expensive commercial version of scientology 's oxford capacity analysis , usually offered free as part of scientology proselytizing in public places , temporarily entered some major german companies who were unaware of its provenance via such a management consultancy firm .
in the mid 2000s , german sect experts expressed concerns that scientologists were becoming active in the german after school tutoring market .
these concerns arose because customers of around CD after school tutoring centres operated by scientologists in frankfurt , hamburg , stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by scientologists , using scientology methods .
brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of l. ron hubbard , the founder of scientology , but not scientology itself .
in early CD , thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the german lutheran church in berlin and brandenburg , and the historian guido knopp both likened the scientologist hollywood actor tom cruise to goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
gandow 's and knopp 's comments found few critics in germany .
most germans consider scientology a subversive organization .
in CD , time reported that CD of germans favoured banning scientology .
a poll conducted in september CD by der spiegel found CD support for a ban .
german scholars such as brigitte schön and gerald willms have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around scientology in germany in their view , efforts to frame information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities .
in schön 's words , this includes both the efforts of german politicians to enhance their popularity with strong worded statements and scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution .
commenting on foreign reporting on scientology in germany , she adds that the american press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to american stereotypes .
both willms and schön assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of scientology .
schön as well as irving hexham , professor of religious studies at the university of calgary in canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by german scholars .
hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the christian churches in germany , which has made german academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate .
in CD a german public broadcaster , ard , showed the film until nothing remains , a dramatized account of the effect scientology had on CD german family .
said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of CD CD CD .
while there have been calls for scientology to be banned , the church of scientology remains legal in germany and is allowed to operate there .
its precise legal status however is unresolved .
CD points are contested first , whether or not the teachings of scientology qualify as a religion or worldview religion or weltanschauung .
these are equal before german law , and secondly , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity .
if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that scientology would not qualify for protection as a religious or worldview community religions oder weltanschauungsgemeinschaft under article CD of the german constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and worldview .
status as a religious or worldview community also affects a broad range of other issues in germany , such as taxation and freedom of association .
the federal court of justice of germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in CD that scientology represented a religious or worldview community .
the upper administrative court in hamburg explicitly asserted in CD that scientology should be viewed as a worldview community .
in another CD decision , the administrative court of baden württemberg in mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity .
in CD , the federal administrative court of germany explicitly granted a scientologist protection under article CD CD of the german constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate .
many courts have declined to assess the religious status of scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand .
the federal administrative court for example ruled in CD that the question whether or not scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities .
the german government does not consider the church of scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that scientology is a profit making enterprise , rather than a religion .
recent years have seen a number of court decisions in scientology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to scientology among politicians and the general public .
given the history of nazism 's rise to power in germany in the 1930s , the present german state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the german constitution .
minister for family policy claudia nolte instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose scientology with all the means at her disposal .
the german church of scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court .
in december CD , the administrative court in berlin ruled against the berlin office for the protection of the constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the church of scientology berlin as paid informants .
the court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate .
in CD , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the berlin office for the protection of the constitution to include the activities of scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution .
at the federal level , scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the bfv in november CD .
the federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of scientology , as outlined by l. ron hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the german constitution .
the court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the church of scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights .
in saarland , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in CD , because there is no local branch of scientology and few members .
as of CD may CD , the church of scientology in germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the bfv after the north rhine westphalia higher administrative court in münster refused to hear an appeal on the matter .
being suspected of maintaining ambitions against the free , democratic basic order , the scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its bylaws .
there is at least CD example of surveillance of scientology by the german intelligence services outside of germany .
in CD , the swiss government detained an agent of the german government , charging him with carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and falsifying identity documents .
the german government posted bail for the agent .
he was eventually given a CD day suspended jail sentence for spying on scientology , and the german government apologized to switzerland for the incident .
a sect filter , also known as a protective declaration schutzerklärung , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract .
such sect filters , primarily used to screen out scientologists , have been drafted by german government agencies for use by businesses .
sect commissioner 's offices exist in germany as part of regional or local government .
a work instruction introduced in CD requires government staff in the arbeitsämter local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the federal ministry of labour and social affairs to mark companies owned by scientologists with the letter s .
where companies are suspected of having scientologist staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff .
government officials have publicised the names of individual scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses .
some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma .
due to concerns about possible government infiltration by scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in bavaria are required to declare whether or not they are scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in hesse .
companies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not scientologists .
in CD , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that the technology of l. ron hubbard will not be used in executing the contract .
when it became known that microsoft 's windows CD operating system included a disk defragmenter developed by executive software international a company headed by a scientologist , this caused concern among german government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage .
to assuage these concerns , microsoft germany agreed to provide a means to disable the utility .
following letters of complaint about discrimination from scientology lawyers , some american companies such as general electric , ibm and ford motor company instructed their german subsidiaries to cease the use of protective declarations .
the city state of hamburg set up a full time office dedicated to opposing scientology , the scientology task force for the hamburg interior authority , under the leadership of ursula caberta .
in CD , in a case brought by a scientologist , the federal administrative court of germany ordered the city of hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice infringed religious freedom .
in june CD , the hamburg administrative court fined the city of hamburg CD CD euros CD CD for not complying with court instructions banning the use of sect filters .
internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available .
eileen barker , a professor of sociology at the london school of economics , has noted that germany has gone further than any other western european country in restricting the civil rights of scientologists .
the hamburg task force was closed down in august CD as a result of budget cuts .
caberta moved to a position within the hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on scientology .
scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in germany such as the christian democratic union , the christian social union of bavaria , the social democratic party of germany and the free democratic party .
existing scientologist members of these parties have been purged , according to time magazine .
scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in germany .
scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked .
thomas gottschalk , a german tv presenter , was falsely accused in CD of having taken part in scientology courses .
gottschalk responded by announcing that he had not , and that he would henceforth cease all contact with a friend who had links to scientology .
in CD , günther oettinger , the minister president of the german state of baden württemberg , expressed concern that scientologist john travolta was to appear on gottschalk 's programme , and asked the zdf tv station to consider revoking the invitation .
the zdf said that uninviting travolta would cause greater damage , and that scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme .
in CD , the bavarian administrative court ruled that a woman working in a children 's daycare centre , whose employment had been terminated when her ex husband identified her as a scientologist , should be reinstated .
the woman had demonstrated to the court 's satisfaction that her scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work .
according to the agreement that concluded the case , she promised not to use scientology methods in her work , and to inform the children 's parents of her membership in scientology .
in march CD , it was reported that german authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor scientology in response to the opening of a new scientology headquarters in berlin .
the move was criticized by german politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts .
sabine weber , president of the church of scientology in berlin , called the accusations unrealistic and absurd and said that the german interior ministers evaluation was based on a few sentences out of CD CD pages of scientological literature .
she added , i can also find hundreds of quotes in the bible that are totalitarian but that does not mean i will demand the ban of christianity .
in november CD , the government abandoned its attempts to ban scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity .
the report by the bfv cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban scientology doubtful .
first , the bfv report stated there was no evidence that scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization .
there were german churches and missions , a german board , german bylaws , and no evidence that the organization was totally remote controlled from the united states .
a foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a german one .
the second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution .
here , the report found that scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow germany 's free and democratic basic order .
neither its bylaws nor any other utterances supported the conclusion that the organization had criminal aims .
the bfv also considered whether there were grounds to act against the church of scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning .
commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , ehrhart körting , berlin 's interior minister , said , this organization pursues goals through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution .
but they put very little of this into practice .
the appraisal of the government at the moment is that scientology is a lousy organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to .
the church of scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the only CD possible .
monitoring of scientology 's activities by the german intelligence services continues .
the decision was upheld in july CD by the upper administrative court of berlin brandenburg which ruled that the poster violated scientologists basic religious rights .
the united states media , while generally reporting negatively on scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards scientology in relation to germany .
richard cohen for example , writing in the washington post , said in CD scientology might be CD weird religion , but the german reaction to it is weirder still not to mention disturbing .
alan cowell , writing in the new york times , wrote in CD that the german response to scientology motivated by officials fear that scientology was a totalitarian movement growing , like the nazi party , from inconsequential beginnings was itself redolent of the nazi era 's authoritarianism .
the you.s. department of state has repeatedly claimed that germany 's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of scientologists individual rights posed by sect filters .
the you.s. department of state began to include the issue of scientology in germany in its annual human rights reports after the CD agreement between the church of scientology and the you.s. internal revenue service , through which scientology gained the status of a tax exempt religion in the united states .
that decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the church of scientology in washington , using paid lobbyists .
the state department 's CD human rights report on germany , released in january CD , warned that artists and businesses with scientology connections may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval .
past targets of such actions had included scientologist actors tom cruise and john travolta , as well as jazz pianist chick corea .
also in january CD , an open letter to then chancellor helmut kohl appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the international herald tribune , drawing parallels between the organized oppression of scientologists in germany and nazi policies espoused by germany in the 1930s .
it echoed similar parallels drawn by the church of scientology itself , which until then had received scant notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of scientology celebrities in washington .
chancellor kohl , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it do not know a thing about germany and do not want to know .
german officials argued that the whole fuss was cranked up by the scientologists to achieve what we will not give them tax exempt status as a religion .
this is intimidation , pure and simple .
officials explained that precisely because of germany 's nazi past , germany took a determined stance against all radical cults and sects , including right wing nazi groups , and not just against scientology .
kohl 's christian democratic union party denounced the letter as absurd and cited german court rulings stating that scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a contemptuous cartel of oppression .
in february CD , a united states immigration court judge granted asylum to a german scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland .
in april CD , john travolta met personally with you.s. president bill clinton at a conference in philadelphia .
travolta later said clinton assured him that he would really love to help with the issue over in germany with scientology .
according to travolta , clinton recalled that he had a roommate years ago who was a scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it , stating that scientologists were given an unfair hand in germany and that he wanted to fix it .
in addition , there are indications that scientology poses a threat to germany 's basic political principles .
a united nations report in april CD raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters .

asahi , asahi was a pre dreadnought battleship built for the imperial japanese navy ijn in the late 1890s .
as japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , the ship was designed and built in the united kingdom .
shortly after her arrival in japan , she became flagship of the standing fleet , the ijn 's primary combat fleet .
she participated in every major naval battle of the russo japanese war of CD CD and was lightly damaged during the battle of the yellow sea and the battle of tsushima .
asahi saw no combat during world war i , although the ship participated in the siberian intervention in CD .
reclassified as a coastal defence ship in CD , asahi was disarmed CD years later to meet the terms of the washington naval treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship .
she was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in CD .
asahi was recommissioned in late CD , after the start of the second sino japanese war , and used to transport japanese troops .
in CD , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at japanese occupied shanghai , china , and then cam ranh bay , french indochina , from late CD to CD .
the ship was transferred to occupied singapore in early CD to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in may .
she was sunk en route by the american submarine uss salmon , although most of her crew survived .
combat experience in the first sino japanese war of CD CD convinced the imperial japanese navy of weaknesses in the jeune naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships .
therefore , japan promulgated a CD year naval build up in early CD , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations , with the construction of CD battleships and CD armoured cruisers at its core .
these ships were paid for from the CD CD CD indemnity paid by china after losing the first sino japanese war .

CD CD CD at a speed of CD knots CD km h .
CD mph .
the ship was fitted with CD steam driven CD CD kilowatt CD CD hp dynamos .
asahi 's main battery consisted of the same CD elswick ordnance company CD calibre CD inch guns used in all of japan 's preceding battleships .
they were mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure .
the hydraulically powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse , at a fixed elevation of CD CD .
each mount could traverse a total of CD degrees .
they fired CD pound CD kg projectiles at a muzzle velocity of CD CD ft s CD m s .
the ship 's secondary armament consisted of CD CD calibre CD inch CD mm quick firing qf guns mounted in casemates .
CD of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other CD guns were placed above them in the superstructure .
they fired CD pound CD kg shells at a muzzle velocity of CD CD ft s CD m s .

the flat portion of the deck armour was CD CD inches CD mm thick and CD inches CD mm thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship .
the conning tower was protected by CD inches of armour .
asahi , like all the other japanese battleships of the time , was fitted with CD barr and stroud fa3 coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of CD CD yards CD CD m .
the ships were also fitted with CD power magnification telescopic gunsights .
asahi , meaning rising sun , a poetic name for japan from a stanza of waka poetry , was laid down on CD august CD in clydebank , scotland , by the clydebank engineering shipbuilding co. and completed by john brown company , which purchased the firm before asahi was completed .
she was launched on CD march CD and completed on CD july CD .
her completion was delayed by about CD months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off southsea following sea trials .
the ship departed england , after repairs in portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at yokosuka , japan , on CD october CD .
asahi became flagship of the standing fleet on CD may CD and was assigned to the 1st battleship division of the 1st fleet when the combined fleet was re formed on CD december CD .
at the start of the russo japanese war , asahi , commanded by captain hikohachi yamada , was assigned to the 1st division of the 1st fleet .
she participated in the battle of port arthur on CD february CD , when vice admiral tōgō heihachirō led the 1st fleet in an attack on the russian ships of the pacific squadron anchored just outside port arthur .
tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack .
the japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the russian defences .
tōgō chose to attack the russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns .
splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the japanese CD inch CD CD and CD inch guns inflicted little damage on the russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the japanese ships with some effect .
although many ships on both sides were hit , russian casualties numbered only CD , while the japanese suffered CD killed and wounded before tōgō disengaged .
asahi was not hit during the engagement .
the ship participated in the action of CD april , when tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the pacific squadron , including vice admiral stepan makarov 's flagship , the battleship petropavlovsk .
when makarov spotted the CD battleships of the 1st division , he turned back for port arthur and petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the japanese the previous night .
the russian battleship sank in less than CD minutes after CD of her magazines exploded , and makarov was CD of the CD killed .
emboldened by his success , tōgō resumed long range bombardment missions , prompting the russians to lay more minefields , which sank CD japanese battleships the following month .
during the battle of the yellow sea on CD august , asahi , now commanded by captain tsunaakira nomoto , was second in line of the column of japanese battleships , behind mikasa , and was CD of the primary targets of the russian ships .
she was only hit by a single CD inch she will that wounded CD crewmen .
both guns in her aft CD inch gun turret , however , were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels .
in turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships poltava and tsesarevich although both ships were only lightly damaged by the japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact .
the ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when CD of her CD inch shells struck the bridge of tsesarevich , killing the russian squadron commander , vice admiral wilgelm vitgeft , CD of his staff officers and the ship 's quartermaster .
the ship 's wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the russian ships into total confusion .
the second in command , rear admiral prince pavel ukhtomsky , eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to port arthur .
slightly more than CD months later , on CD october , asahi struck a mine off port arthur while on blockade duty .
severely damaged , she was under repair at sasebo naval arsenal from november CD to april CD .
russian naval forces in the far east had been destroyed or neutralized by this time and the russians were forced to transfer ships from the baltic fleet that did not arrive until may .
at the battle of tsushima on CD may CD , asahi again followed the battleship mikasa into combat , this time against the second and third pacific squadrons .
mikasa opened fire at the battleship knyaz suvorov , the russian flagship , at CD CD , and was joined by asahi and the armoured cruiser azuma shortly afterwards .
within an hour the japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the russian ship , badly wounded the fleet commander , vice admiral zinovy rozhestvensky , knocked out her rear CD inch gun turret , and jammed knyaz suvorov 's steering so that she fell out of formation .
the russian ships were concentrating their fire on mikasa during the early part of the battle and asahi was not damaged during this time .
tōgō was able to cross the t of the russian squadrons .
knyaz suvorov 's steering was later repaired , but she blundered between the japanese and russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged .

descended from a prominent political family , beckham was chosen as democrat william goebel 's running mate in the gubernatorial election of CD despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so .
goebel lost the election to republican william s. taylor , but the kentucky general assembly disputed the election results .
during the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot goebel .
a day later the general assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to goebel , who was sworn into office on his deathbed .
taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the democratic majority in the general assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and beckham over the governorship .
beckham ultimately prevailed and taylor fled the state .
following his term as governor , beckham made a bid to become a you.s. senator .
his stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of CD legislators in his own party and the seat went to republican william o. bradley .
CD years later beckham secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re election bid largely because of his pro temperance views and his opposition to women 's suffrage .

concurrently , he studied law at the university of kentucky , where he earned his law degree in CD .
he was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in bardstown in CD .
he also served as president of the young democrats club of nelson county .
beckham 's political career began in CD when he was elected without opposition to the kentucky house of representatives .
he served CD consecutive terms and was speaker of the house in CD , his final year in the house .
he also served as a delegate to every democratic national convention from CD to CD .
democrat william goebel chose beckham as his running mate in the kentucky gubernatorial election of CD .
goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election , and beckham 's native nelson county was already committed to a rival candidate .
but friends of goebel assured him that beckham would be loyal to goebel 's reform agenda , whereas the CD other men goebel was considering as running mates would stack the senate committees against him .
beckham was not yet CD , the minimum age to serve as governor , at the time of his selection .
goebel lost a close election to republican william s. taylor .
when the general assembly 's session opened on january CD , CD , the election results were immediately challenged .
with democrats in control of both houses of the assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed .
the assembly was still deliberating on january CD , CD , when goebel was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building .

CD days later goebel died , never having risen from the bed .
legislative chaos ensued as taylor refused to acknowledge the assembly 's decision and vacate the governorship .

the case first went before the louisville circuit court , which found in favor of beckham .
republicans appealed to the kentucky court of appeals , at that time the court of last resort in the state .
on april CD , CD , the court of appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court .
taylor appealed to the supreme court of the united states , which declined to hear the case on may CD , CD .
taylor 's only supporter on the court was kentuckian john marshall harlan .
following the supreme court ruling , taylor fled to indianapolis , indiana , fearing he would be implicated in goebel 's assassination .
beckham became acting governor , but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election , a special election was held november CD , CD , to determine who would complete goebel 's unexpired term .
beckham now of age won the election over republican john w. yerkes by fewer than CD CD votes .
shortly following the special election , beckham married jean raphael fuqua of owensboro .
the couple had CD sons .
as governor beckham sought to unite his party and the state .

he stressed non controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state 's educational system .
he recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices , a reform both he and goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign .
however , his passive leadership ensured that the general assembly did little to address his agenda .
the only major pieces of legislation passed during beckham 's term were a tax increase that added a half CD dollars to the state 's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under CD to work without their parents consent .
although the kentucky constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , beckham announced he would seek a full term as governor in CD .
his candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run .
due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non controversial reforms , he had no significant opposition in winning his party 's nomination .
his record also deprived his republican opponent , morris b. belknap , of any significant campaign issue in the general election .
beckham defeated belknap and CD minor candidates .
in his message to the legislature in CD , beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law , which had not passed during his first term .
the law was CD of few significant reforms that passed during the CD session .
during the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late governor goebel .
in march CD , beckham signed the day law mandating racial segregation of all schools in kentucky .
berea college , a private college in eastern kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s , immediately filed suit to challenge the law .
the substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the kentucky court of appeals .
berea appealed to the supreme court , and in CD the court handed down an CD CD decision against the college .
only john marshall harlan dissented .
near the close of the CD session , legislators approved the creation of beckham county from parts of carter , elliott , and lewis counties .
olive hill was made the county seat .
soon the county 's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the CD square miles CD CD km2 required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than CD square miles CD CD km2 .
carter county joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of beckham county passed too close to grayson , the seat of carter county , and vanceburg , the seat of lewis county .
the state constitution forbade county borders to pass within CD miles CD km of a county seat .
on april CD , CD , the kentucky court of appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved beckham county .
during the CD legislative session , beckham urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies , following the lead of new york attorney charles evans hughes .

he further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in kentucky , bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud .
beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing black patch tobacco wars .

by collecting some old civil war debts from the federal government , beckham virtually eliminated the state 's debt .
encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the general assembly voted to expand CD of the state 's normal schools , western state teachers college in bowling green later western kentucky university and eastern state teachers college in richmond later part of eastern kentucky university .
with a successful legislative session behind him , beckham made a bold political move in june CD he orchestrated an effort to set the democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in november a full year before the gubernatorial election and CD years before the senatorial election .
beckham wanted the senate seat , and moving the primary up CD years would allow him to secure his party 's nomination while he was still governor .
it also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party 's choice of his potential successor as governor .
state auditor samuel wilbur hager was beckham 's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger n.b. hays .
former governor james b. mccreary challenged beckham for the senatorial nomination , but beckham won by more than CD CD votes .
beckham 's term as governor ended december CD , CD .
in january CD he faced the legislature as the democratic nominee for a seat in the you.s. senate by virtue of the primary held CD years earlier .
the republicans nominated former governor william o. bradley .
on the first ballot beckham secured CD of the needed CD votes .
bradley received CD votes .
CD democrats had not voted for beckham .
over the next CD weeks , CD more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority , even though william jennings bryan , the democratic nominee for president , campaigned for beckham .
some democrats pressured beckham to withdraw and allow a more palatable democrat to run , but he refused .
on the 29th ballot , taken near the end of february CD , bradley finally secured a majority after CD democrats crossed party lines to vote for him .
beckham 's ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election .
his position put him at odds with henry watterson , editor of the powerful louisville courier journal .
as governor beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in louisville .
when the kentucky court of appeals invalidated the results of louisville 's municipal elections due to interference by the city 's whiskey ring in may CD , beckham appointed robert worth bingham , a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist , as interim mayor until elections could be held in november .
bingham eliminated grafting in the police department , closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on sunday .
following this , the whiskey ring announced beckham had forfeited the support of louisville 's legislators .
in the senatorial election in CD , CD of the CD democrats who voted against beckham were from louisville .
following his defeat , beckham returned to his law practice .
CD years later beckham again attempted to win the senate seat .
due to the passage of the seventeenth amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote .
in the democratic primary beckham defeated augustus o. stanley , a CD year veteran congressman .
the republican nominee was former governor augustus e. willson .
bolstered by his support of president woodrow wilson , beckham won the election by CD CD votes .
beckham served as chairman of the senate committee on expenditures in the department of labor from CD to CD and on the senate committee on military affairs .
in the latter position he was influential in securing CD large military training posts for kentucky , camp zachary taylor and fort knox .
though camp zachary taylor was abandoned after world war i , fort knox became the home of the united states bullion depository .
when the united states entered world war i , beckham continued to back president wilson and supported the league of nations .
true to his prohibitionist stance , beckham supported passage of the eighteenth amendment forbidding the import and sale of alcohol in the united states .
the amendment was ratified and became effective in january CD .
believing women should be protected from involvement in politics , beckham opposed the nineteenth amendment , which granted women 's suffrage .
the amendment failed on february CD , CD , but passed on june CD , CD .
beckham voted against it both times .
the democrats renominated beckham without opposition in CD .
his opponent in the general election was republican richard p. ernst .
prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state , and in areas where these industries were prominent beckham received more than CD CD fewer votes than democratic presidential nominee james m. cox .
he was also hurt by the women 's vote and by his support of president wilson , who had lost popularity since beckham 's election in CD .
ernst won the election by fewer than CD CD votes , winning the race with CD CD percent of the vote to beckham 's CD CD percent .
during his single term in the senate beckham served alongside CD other you.s. senators from kentucky ollie m. james , george b. martin and augustus o. stanley .
following his term in the senate , beckham resumed his legal practice in louisville .
he sought another term as governor in CD .
this time he had the support of the louisville courier journal , which had been purchased by his ally , robert w. bingham .
he was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the jockey club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state 's horse racetracks .
the jockey club ran a candidate in both parties primary elections .
in the democratic primary beckham defeated the club 's relatively obscure candidate , robert t. crowe .
flem d. sampson , the club 's nominee in the republican primary , won his party 's nomination .
in the general election beckham could not secure the support of democratic governor william j. fields , who had been elected with the help of the jockey club .
despite the democrats winning every other contest on the ballot , including the race for lieutenant governor , beckham lost to sampson by more than CD CD votes .
it was estimated that the club spent over CD CD to defeat him .
beckham was expected to be the democrats nominee for governor in CD , but the death of his son in late CD left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign .
the democrats turned to a. b. happy chandler of henderson , who won the election .
beckham supported chandler 's bid , and in return chandler appointed him to the kentucky public service commission in CD .
beckham also served on the department of business regulations commission and chaired the state government reorganization commission .
beckham attempted to return to the senate in CD .
the head of the jockey club , james b. brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in CD .
in CD beckham 's ally , robert bingham , had been appointed ambassador to the court of st. james 's , increasing his prominence and influence .
beckham also enjoyed the support of the united mine workers and louisville mayor neville miller .
the race was complicated , though , by the entry of john y. brown , a democrat who was a you.s. representative and former speaker of the kentucky house of representatives .
he had agreed to support chandler 's bid for the governorship in exchange for chandler 's support in his run for the senate .
however , chandler threw his support to beckham , and while brown was not able to win the seat without the support of bingham and chandler , he did garner CD CD votes , most of them at beckham 's expense .
democratic incumbent m. m. logan retained the seat by CD CD votes .
beckham died in louisville on january CD , CD , and was buried in frankfort cemetery in frankfort , kentucky .
beckham county , oklahoma , was named in his honor at the suggestion of a kentuckian who was serving as a delegate to oklahoma 's constitutional convention in CD .
wickland , his birthplace , was added to the national register of historic places on february CD , CD .
the CD CD new zealand native football team was a new zealand rugby union team that toured britain , ireland , australia and new zealand in CD and CD .
it mostly comprised players of māori ancestry , and also included some pākehā white new zealanders .
a wholly private endeavour , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority .
it was organised by new zealand international player joseph warbrick , promoted by civil servant thomas eyton , and managed by james scott , a publican .
the natives were the first new zealand team to perform a haka , and also the first to wear all black .
they played CD rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of victorian rules football and association football matches in australia .
having made a significant impact on the development of new zealand rugby , the natives were inducted into the international rugby board hall of fame in CD .
after a preliminary tour of new zealand in CD , the side travelled to england via melbourne and suez .
the māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the british press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as māori as they had expected .
playing their first match , on CD october against surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played CD matches per week .
their early matches included a CD CD loss to middlesex , but their form improved in november , when they won CD of their CD matches .
the team played its first international match on CD december , against ireland , and won CD CD .
this was followed by a win over CD of the strongest english county teams , yorkshire , and a CD CD defeat against the wales national team .
by january CD the natives had played CD matches in less than CD months , winning CD of them .
they had spent most of their time in the north of england , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable .
in a return match on CD january , yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted CD of the natives heaviest losses , a CD CD defeat .
the team then went undefeated until CD february , when they faced england .
england eventually won CD CD .
the natives apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired .
the new zealanders left england without an official send off , and travelled to australia where they toured victoria , new south wales and queensland .
they then returned to new zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before .
they went CD games undefeated before losing their final match , on CD august CD , CD CD to auckland .
the natives final record in rugby matches was CD wins , CD draws and CD losses .
they introduced a number of tactical innovations to new zealand rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the new zealand rugby football union in CD .
CD of the team 's CD players went on to play provincially in new zealand , and CD , thomas ellison and david gage , subsequently captained the new zealand national rugby team .
the idea for assembling a team of māori footballers to tour britain was conceived by joseph warbrick , a rugby player who had toured with the first new zealand national team in CD .
he initially proposed a team of māori or part māori to play the touring british side in CD .
this developed into a venture to have a māori team tour britain if a preliminary tour of new zealand were successful .
hearing of warbrick 's plans , civil servant thomas eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which warbrick accepted .
when james scott , a publican , subsequently joined the partnership , the CD men decided that warbrick would be the team 's captain , scott its manager and eyton its promoter .
warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in early CD .
he had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented jack taiaroa due to his university commitments .
some māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part māori .
twenty māori or part māori players joined the squad .
CD pākehā white new zealand players were added after the team lost to auckland .
due to the inclusion of these pākehā players the team was renamed from the new zealand maori to the new zealand native football representatives .
the final squad comprised CD players including warbrick .
of these at least CD were full blooded māori , while CD had a māori mother and a pākehā father .
the parentage of some of the players is unknown .
the team toured new zealand before departing overseas , playing against hawke 's bay , auckland , nelson , wellington , canterbury , south canterbury , and otago .
the first game was contested against hawke 's bay in napier on CD june CD .
they played CD games in their preliminary tour of new zealand , and won CD of them .
their last new zealand match before departure , against otago played in dunedin on CD july CD , was won by CD try to nil .
the team sailed for australia from dunedin , leaving on CD august CD .
in melbourne , scott recruited jack lawlor to train the players in victorian rules football in britain as preparation for possible victorian rules matches on their return to australia .
the team played CD rugby matches against the melbourne rugby union team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to britain via suez .
they arrived in london on CD september CD .
the team were met in britain by local rugby administrators , including an official of england 's rugby football union rfu .
the first match of the tour was against surrey , where the team became the first new zealand side to perform a haka , and also the first to wear an all black uniform .
that the team was predominantly māori provoked curiosity from the british press at the time , most britons had not seen non white people but there was some surprise that the team were not as māori as had been expected .
they are not unlike europeans , a scottish reporter wrote in november CD .
that is their resemblance is great when CD remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation .
the surrey match , which was refereed by the rfu secretary george rowland hill , was won CD CD by the natives after they scored CD tries .
the natives next defeated both northamptonshire and kent , before defeats by moseley and burton on trent .
both defeats were unexpected , and in the moseley match , injuries played a part the tourists played most of the match at least CD men down , as replacements were then not allowed .
the team recovered to win their next game , against midlands counties in birmingham .
their next fixture was against middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the earl of sheffield at sheffield park , uckfield .
the middlesex side contained a number of international players , including arthur gould .
middlesex won easily , with the natives play characterised by poor tackling .
the final score was CD CD , with CD tries conceded by the new zealanders .
prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine an indulgence the natives were not used to .
a report in the auckland star had this to say of the game
the new zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition CD of scratch players , whereas mr rowland hill had carefully collected the best possible team available .
such passing as the home men displayed the maoris frankly admit they have never previously witnessed .
said mccausland whilst we were on the platform waiting for the london train , i think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been in good form .
following the match against middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest english rugby teams were based .
yorkshire and lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the rfu in CD over the issue of broken time payments .
the new zealanders lost to hull CD CD , defeated dewsbury , then lost to wakefield .
after their first draw of the tour against northumberland county they defeated stockton on tees and tynemouth .
joe warbrick appeared in the match against tynemouth , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point .
these victories were followed by a CD CD defeat to halifax on CD november .
the team then won CD matches in a row , including CD against hawick rfc , their only scottish opposition of the tour .
the last CD matches that month were a loss to swinton and a CD CD victory over liverpool and district .
the team had played CD fixtures during november and won CD of them .
by this point , the team was beset by injuries of the fifteen players that played against westmorland county on CD november , CD had injuries .
the squad comprised only CD players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side .
nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued .
on CD november CD they left for dublin , where a match had been organised against the ireland national team .
the ireland fixture was played at lansdowne road , dublin , on CD december CD .
both teams had a number of leading players out injured the irish were forced to make CD changes to their original selection .
ireland led CD CD at half time after scoring a converted try , but the natives improved considerably in the second half , scoring CD tries .
patrick keogh scored the first CD tries , and his play was praised by the local press .
the third try scored was by thomas ellison after a counter attack by george williams .
the try was not converted , but the strong finish from the new zealanders gave the visitors a CD CD victory .
the irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but ireland did go on to defeat wales CD tries to nil in the CD home nations championship .
following their defeat of ireland , the natives played trinity college and then north of ireland .
the match against trinity college was drawn CD CD , and despite keogh not playing , the native side played much better than their previous fixture .
the team then travelled to belfast , where they defeated north of ireland CD CD on CD december .
scoring CD tries to nil .
after returning to england , the natives faced lancashire in manchester , where they lost CD CD .
CD days later they drew with batley bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring CD tries .
their next match was against yorkshire , who were CD of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural county championship that season .
yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated CD CD by the natives , who scored CD tries .
after a further CD victories , the team travelled to wales , where they lost CD CD to llanelli , before facing wales on CD december .
at the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the welsh team due to fans of both swansea and llanelli feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players .
CD teams dominated welsh international selection at the time , and out of the CD man team only william towers and william bowen of swansea and dan griffiths of llanelli had been selected .
the match was played in swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only CD recorded .
the crowd 's hostility impacted on the players , and debutant norman biggs was palpably nervous at the start of the match .
biggs , aged CD years and CD days , became the youngest welsh international player a record he held until the debut of tom prydie in CD .
despite the heckles aimed primarily at biggs , charlie arthur and george thomas , the welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards .
towers scored the first welsh try , which was converted by jim webb .
the natives replied with a spirited run by ellison , but he failed to break through the welsh defence .
the tourists trailed even further after george thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half way line , which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd .
webb , playing in out of position at full back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark .
the natives continued to push , with elliot coming within CD yards of the try line , and when ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the CD yard line before he could touch down .
in the second half wales continued to push their advantage when alexander bland dribbled the ball into the natives CD .
this was collected by sydney nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing jim hannan to score .
warbrick for the natives and stadden for wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game .
the match was also of historical importance because of the welsh tactics employed .
in the CD home nations championship wales had trialled the CD CD quarter system , wherein the team would play with CD forwards rather than CD , and instead employ an extra centre CD quarter .
the system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star welsh player arthur gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team newport to retain the additional forward .
with gould working in the west indies , wales again tried the CD CD quarter system against the natives , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system .
within CD years the other CD home countries had adopted CD CD quarter style of play .
before they left wales , the natives played swansea and CD other local clubs , newport , and cardiff .
they defeated swansea for their first win in wales , and followed this up with a victory over newport in front of CD CD spectators .
they finished their welsh matches , and the year , with a CD CD loss to cardiff in front of a partisan crowd .
the side entered CD having played CD matches for CD wins and CD draws .
the natives play had improved throughout november and december following poorer form in their october matches .
positive press reports reflected this improvement .
the team would go on to play a further CD matches before their CD february international against england .
january started with a CD CD loss to bradford , during which CD police officers were required to keep many of the CD CD spectators , many of them non paying , in order .
this was followed by victories over leeds parish church , kirkstall , brighouse rangers , and huddersfield .
following further matches against stockport , castleford , and warrington , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced yorkshire for a second time .
yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line up against the natives when the sides first met in december .
after the unexpected loss , yorkshire were determined to make amends and a strong side was selected for the county , including fred bonsor , richard lockwood and john willie sutcliffe , all of whom would appear for england against the natives later that season .
described as knocked about and stale , the natives struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and yorkshire scored CD converted tries before a try to ellison left the scores at CD CD at half time .
the second half was little better for the natives .
they conceded a further CD tries as well as a drop goal .
the second of these tries was scored by lockwood after he ran the ball from his own half .
ellison scored a converted try late in the match , but this did not prevent the natives suffering their largest defeat of the tour CD CD to the yorkshiremen .
ellison later described the match as without a murmur , the biggest beating we received in our whole tour .
after a victory over spen valley district , the team travelled west to play somersetshire , devonshire , taunton , and gloucestershire , and won all CD games .
the victory over somerset was the new zealanders largest of the tour .
they scored CD tries in a CD CD victory .
half back keogh played outstandingly for the natives , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition .
devonshire and tauton suffered heavy defeats by the new zealanders , before a strong gloucestershire side was dismissed .
after defeating midland counties , the natives returned to london .
the team had CD further matches before their international against england .
the first was against CD of the strongest clubs in england , blackheath .
andrew stoddart , who had toured new zealand and australia with the CD british isles side , played for the club in their CD CD defeat to the natives .
the new zealanders won having scored CD tries , including CD by keogh .
their next opposition was a united services side mainly comprising royal navy players .
the natives were again victorious , this time CD CD .
the match against oxford university was postponed due to heavy frost , and so the team had a CD day break from playing their longest of the tour .
the match against england was causing the natives players and management problems before it had even begun .
the strictly amateur rfu establishment were already suspicious of the profit making motives of the natives , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue .
the rfu was also in dispute with the other home unions over the formation of the international rugby football board irfb .
ireland , wales and scotland consequently refused to play against england until CD , when , following arbitration , the rfu relented and joined the irfb .
the absence of international matches was a factor in england agreeing to face the natives on CD february CD .
the line ups selected for the CD february match were both strong , and close to full strength .
though CD of the england side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level .
the match was refereed by rowland hill , who had also officiated the natives first match in britain , against surrey .
the opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and scrummaging on the heavy ground .
later in the half england scored CD tries through harry bedford , but both were disputed by the natives , who claimed that CD of their players had grounded the ball in goal .
england took the CD try advantage into the second half .
early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the english .
the try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the natives and the rfu .
ellison attempted to tackle the english player stoddart , and in the process ripped his shorts off .
the natives quickly formed a circle around stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen .
while this was happening CD of the english players , frank evershed , picked up the ball and scored a try .
the new zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming stoddart had called dead ball but hill awarded the try , prompting CD of the native players , dick taiaroa , williams , and sherry wynyard , to leave the field in protest .
the aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before hill had restarted play .
ellison was very critical of hill , particularly because he was also secretary of the rfu .
ellison wrote after the tour that gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that mr hill committed at the outset of the game , viz , refereeing at all in that game .
the disputed try was followed by a final try for the english , who ultimately won CD CD .
the rfu , at hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the natives captain of the day , edward mccausland , who had led the team as joe warbrick was injured .
the english authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the new zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike .
the rfu threatened to bar any of their affiliated players in other words , the entire rugby playing population of england from facing the natives if they did not apologise .
mccausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate .
he therefore sent another , CD days after the game
the london establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the new zealanders approach to the game .
reports of rough and over aggressive play by the natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in britain .
in the north of england , criticism of the visitors sportsmanship was rarer .
the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south .
some of the natives , including joe warbrick , accused the rfu and the english press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to criticise the new zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players .
the natives remained in london following the england international .
they defeated london welsh on CD february , before losing first to cambridge , then oxford university .
from there they travelled north and won CD matches before losing to leigh .
after a win over runcorn , there was a defeat to oldham , played on a ground eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous .
after reversing their previous loss to halifax with a CD CD win , the natives suffered a loss to barrow and district on CD march .
the new zealanders then had a run of CD straight wins before a CD CD draw with hull .
widnes were then defeated for the second time in CD weeks in the tourists last match in northern england .
the team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in britain .
they eventually played southern counties , and beat them CD CD .
this was their 74th match in the british isles and their 49th victory .
the authorities and press in london continued to view the team negatively , and the natives boarded ship without a formal farewell .
this perceived affront from the rfu provoked some criticism from the press outside london , as well as from the team manager scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the england match , the controversy should have put to rest .
the majority of the natives left plymouth on CD march eyton and pie wynyard followed a week later .
they arrived in melbourne in may , where the team played mostly victorian rules football , hoping to make more money that way .
although the side had employed jack lawlor to coach them in victorian rules during their tour of the british isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training .
as a result , the victorian rules matches were a failure .
the players unfamiliarity with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the natives were rugby forwards and therefore less suited to the more open victorian rules , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds .
the side played CD victorian rules matches in total , including CD in new south wales , but won only CD of them , all against relatively weak opposition .
the side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in victorian rules the new zealanders played CD rugby matches while in victoria against melbourne , a navy selection , and victoria .
the matches were all won , with their game against victoria a CD CD victory .
after this they left for sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated new south wales CD CD .
after CD further victories , the side again faced new south wales , and won the match CD CD .
another CD victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour both defeats .
the team travelled north to queensland , where , as in new south wales , rugby was the dominant code of football .
consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region .
the natives faced queensland at the association ground in brisbane .
the CD spectators witnessed the new zealanders overwhelm the queenslanders to win CD CD .
the natives did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance .
after a further CD matches , against toowoomba and ipswich both of whom were comfortably defeated , the team returned to brisbane for a rematch with queensland .
in contrast to their first meeting , the first half was a close affair , and the CD sides were tied at the conclusion of the half .
billy warbrick suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second half .
following the loss of warbrick , the play of the natives improved and they recovered to win CD CD .
not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered CD by bookmakers to throw the game .
eyton later said
it was on the occasion of this match that CD of our players were thought , in racing parlance , to be playing stiff , and that they had been got by some bookies .
at all events , when accused of it at half time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half .
the response from the team 's management was to suspend CD players .
the team travelled to toowoomba , where they defeated the locals CD CD .
the natives included a replacement player for only the second time , charles speakman , after the suspensions reduced the playing strength of the side .
the team then travelled back to new zealand , and arrived in invercargill on CD august .
CD days after their return , the natives faced southland , who they defeated CD CD in front of a crowd of CD CD .
the side suffered further injury , to harry lee , and recruited southlander w. hirst for their match against mataura district on CD august .
despite playing the match CD players down , the natives comfortably defeated mataura CD CD .
following the side 's return to new zealand , the otago rugby football union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in queensland .
eyton responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred .
the northern rugby union since renamed queensland rugby union summarised the incident and aftermath in the CD queensland rugby union annual
it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the maori , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination .
CD members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match .
it is unlikely , given the attitude of the otago rugby union to the natives before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if incriminating evidence had existed .
the side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced otago in dunedin .
the natives outscored their opponents CD tries to CD , and won CD CD .
the side 's star player and half back , keogh , stayed in dunedin when the team departed for christchurch .
the side faced hawke 's bay , who were touring , in christchurch , and handily defeated them CD CD .
the natives play was praised by the press the wearers of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and quickness between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet .
the side then faced canterbury on CD august , who they thrashed CD CD .
the report published in the press said of the natives performance
the play showed on saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men .
in the loose , in the scrum , dribbling , passing , collaring , or running they were very much indeed canterbury 's superior .
the side left christchurch and travelled north where they played wairarapa in masterton .
the match was won CD CD , and the next day they faced wellington , who they also defeated .
the fixture against wellington was nearly abandoned because scott and the wellington rugby union could not agree on a venue .
the match went ahead only when the wellington officials agreed to cede the natives all profit from the match .
after this the natives travelled to auckland where they played their last match , against the province on CD august .
the match was lost CD CD after each team scored CD tries each , but the aucklanders kicked a drop goal and a conversion .
the loss ended a remarkable run of matches the natives had a CD game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over widnes on CD march .
the side won CD , and drew CD match between the defeats .
the tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within new zealand .
it was the first tour of the british isles by a team from the southern hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport .
by the time the natives returned to new zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations .
CD of the CD players went on to play provincially in new zealand , and CD , ellison and david gage , subsequently captained new zealand .

gauthier september CD , CD december CD , CD was a canadian american mezzo soprano and voice teacher .
she performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the american premieres of several works by erik satie , maurice ravel and igor stravinsky , including the title role in the latter 's perséphone .
the niece of lady laurier and sir wilfrid laurier , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed in europe .
she then travelled to java and for CD years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced to north american audiences on her return .
she retired from performing in CD , and opened a voice studio in new york , where she became a founding member of the american guild of musical artists and served on its board of governors .
gauthier was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music .
the citation from the campion society of san francisco , which she received in CD , said her rare open mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers
born in ottawa , ontario , gauthier received musical lessons as a child , in harmony , voice , and piano .
gauthier travelled to france , where she received private voice lessons from auguste jean dubulle of the paris conservatory .
nodules on her vocal cords were problematic , but they were removed surgically .
she later began training under jacques bouhy , whom she would later credit for her vocal technique .
in CD , gauthier was retained by fellow canadian singer emma albani to accompany her on a tour of england and her canadian farewell tour .
albani provided a degree of mentorship to gauthier during the CD week tour of canada .
lord strathcona awarded gauthier a scholarship in CD that allowed her to return to europe and continue her vocal studies .
she returned there and continued both to study and give performances .
her first operatic performance came in CD in pavia , italy as micaëla in bizet 's carmen .
she landed a second operatic role as mallika in delibes lakmé , which was being performed by the london covent garden opera company .
the opera opened in june CD .
supposedly , luisa tetrazzini , the prima donna soprano of the company , feared that gauthier 's voice would outshine her own , and demanded that gauthier be removed from the opera .
the company 's director acquiesced to tetrazzini 's demands , informing gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing .
gauthier reacted badly , and quit opera entirely .
disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene , gauthier departed europe and travelled to java .
there , she met a dutch importer and plantation manager named frans knoote .
gauthier and knoote married on may CD , CD .
gauthier studied the music of java , and began to include this in her repertoire .
her accompanying pianist was paul seelig , who had previously been the conductor for the kraton of surakarta , which afforded gauthier a number of opportunities .
on permission of the javanese court , she studied the gamelan , probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity .
while living in java , gauthier travelled extensively , giving performances in china , japan , singapore , malaya , australia , and new zealand .
she remained in java for CD years , but with the outbreak of world war i she decided to travel back to north america , arriving in new york city in the fall of CD .
arriving in new york , gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene .
she put on a performance in vaudeville entitled songmotion , which combined javan music with dancers .
new york was already home to many north american and european musical performers , so gauthier focused on her javan musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing .
gauthier began giving annual recitals at aeolian hall , and in november CD her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers .
she developed her own reputation quickly , known as a sensitive purveyor of interesting , untried songs .
she gave renditions of CD songs by maurice ravel .
her performance then also included american premieres of stravinsky 's CD japanese lyrics and griffes five poems of ancient china and japan .
the performance was a great success , and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers .
stravinsky arranged to have gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces .
gauthier travelled to paris in CD at the behest of the music league of america .
sent there to arrange a tour of north america by maurice ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with erik satie and les CD .
this led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert .
she accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform pierrot lunaire by arnold schoenberg .
through this , gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary french music across the united states .
she also included american music in all of her concerts .
gauthier toured america frequently and returned to europe in CD , and again in CD .
she began to explore jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics .
her CD annual performance at aeolian hall entitled recital of ancient and modern music for voice became a historic occasion when she presented the works of george gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert .
the first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time .
she performed both classical works by vincenzo bellini and henry purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by arnold schoenberg , darius milhaud , béla bartók , and paul hindemith .
the second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however .
she opened with alexander 's ragtime band by irving berlin , then performed works by jerome kern and walter donaldson , and finally finished with CD works by george gershwin i will build a stairway to paradise , innocent ingénue baby , and swanee .
gershwin played the piano for these pieces .
important figures in the audience included ernestine schumann heink , virgil thomson , and paul whiteman .
although some musical critics panned her decision to include jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .
gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences .
on some occasions , such as her performances of gershwin in new york in CD and CD , as well as in london in CD , this was quite successful .
a critic in vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances schubert , brahms , wolf , richard strauss while praising her skill with more classical choices .
other performances suffered she was booed while performing works by heitor villa lobos at the festival of the international society of contemporary music in venice .
she became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the united states , europe , and her native canada .
on the sixtieth anniversary of canadian confederation in CD , she gave a performance in ottawa which was the first transcontinental radio broadcast in canada .
although she toured canada from time to time , and attended performances of canadian music in new york , she held a negative opinion of canada 's treatment of native musicians , saying canadians .
. .
would rather listen to foreigners than their own people .
illness forced gauthier to halt giving performances in the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage in CD , giving a concert in havana , cuba .
as time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching , and less and less in stage performing .
her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring .
she retired from performing entirely in CD , and opened a music studio in new york .
there she became a founding member of the american guild of musical artists , serving on its board of governors .
she died on december CD , CD .
gauthier was a controversial musician in her time .
her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and often praised .
the appropriateness of jazz music for a classically trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to cheer her for promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to condemn her for taking lowbrow music into a highbrow venue .
a may CD , CD review by the new york times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the unpolished quality of her voice .
her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised her singing of songs by frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them .
a november CD , CD time review of her performance of historic italian songs , as well as modern english , french , austrian , german and american numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music .
the critic remarked her voice was much too good for jazz .
here she was praised as a serious , scholarly artist whose performance was neat and expressive .
the audience received the concert very enthusiastically .
her performance in fargo in CD resulted in a headline in the fargo forum the next day that was headed eva gauthier s program sets whole town buzzing many people are of CD minds regarding jazz numbers some reluctantly admit that they like them others keep silent or condemn them .
the review divides the audience and critics into various camps those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance .
those who openly disliked and condemned it .
those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate .
and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or uncultured .

the battle of sullivan 's island or the battle of fort sullivan was fought on june CD , CD , during the american revolutionary war .
it took place near charleston , south carolina , during the first british attempt to capture the city from american rebels .
it is also sometimes referred to as the first siege of charleston , owing to a more successful british siege in CD .
the british organized an expedition in early CD for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of north america .
delayed by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of north carolina in may CD .
finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , general henry clinton and admiral sir peter parker decided instead to act against charleston .
arriving there in early june , troops were landed on long island , near sullivan 's island where colonel william moultrie commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault .
general charles lee , commanding the southern continental theater of the war , would provide supervision .
the land assault was frustrated when the channel between the CD islands was found to be too deep to wade , and the american defenses prevented an amphibious landing .
the naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the spongy nature of the fort 's palmetto log construction .
careful fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the british fleet , which withdrew after an entire day 's bombardment .
the british withdrew their expedition force to new york , and did not return to south carolina until CD .
when the american revolutionary war broke out in CD , the city of charleston in the colony of south carolina was a center of commerce in southern north america .
the city 's citizens joined other colonists in opposing the british parliament 's attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the april CD battles of lexington and concord .
throughout CD and into CD , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony 's backcountry , the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city .
british army forces in north america were primarily tied up with the siege of boston in CD .
seeking bases of operations where they had more control , the british planned an expedition to the southern colonies .
major general henry clinton , then in boston , was to travel to cape fear , north carolina , where he would join with largely scottish loyalists raised in the north carolina backcountry , and a force of CD CD men from ireland under the command of major general charles cornwallis .
the plan was beset by difficulties from the start .
the irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of december CD , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its CD CD troops did not depart until february CD , CD , escorted by CD warships under the command of admiral sir peter parker .
clinton left boston on january CD with CD companies of light infantry , and first stopped at new york city to confer with william tryon , new york 's royal governor .
major general charles lee , sent by major general george washington to see to the defense of new york , coincidentally arrived there the same day as clinton .
new york was at that time extremely tense .
patriot forces were beginning to disarm and evict loyalists , and the british fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions .
despite this , clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south .
lee observed that this was certainly a droll way of proceeding .
to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited .
this was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists .
a letter intercepted in december had already provided intelligence that the british were planning to go to the south .
clinton arrived at cape fear on march CD , expecting to find the european convoy already there .
he met with the royal governors of north and south carolina , josiah martin and william campbell , and learned that the recruited scottish loyalists had been defeated at moore 's creek bridge CD weeks earlier .
clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of georgia , james wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship .
parker 's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing .
battered by storms and high seas , the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at cape fear until april CD , and cornwallis did not arrive until may CD .
after several weeks there , in which the british troops raided patriot properties , clinton , cornwallis and parker concluded that cape fear was not a suitable base for further operations .
parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast , and reports on the partially finished condition of the charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there .
john rutledge , recently elected president of the general assembly that remained as the backbone of south carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of CD year old colonel william moultrie , a former militiaman and indian fighter .
these forces comprised CD infantry regiments , CD rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment .
they were augmented by CD independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about CD CD .
these forces were further augmented by the arrival of continental regiments from north carolina and virginia CD CD troops , as well as militia numbering CD CD from charleston and the surrounding backcountry .
moultrie saw sullivan 's island , a sandy spit of land at the entrance to charleston harbor extending north about CD miles CD CD km long and a few CD yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships .
a large vessel sailing into charleston first had to cross charleston bar , a series of submerged shoals lying about CD miles CD km southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of sullivan 's island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor .
later it would also have to pass the northern end of james island , where fort johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city .
moultrie and his 2nd south carolina regiment arrived on sullivan 's island in march CD , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into charleston harbor .
the construction moved slowly .
captain peter horry of the patriot naval detachment described the site as an immense pen CD feet long , and CD feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot .
the gun platforms were made of planks CD inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes .
congress had appointed general lee to command the continental army troops in the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those of clinton 's fleet as it sailed south .
lee wrote from wilmington on june CD that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for virginia or south carolina .
he headed for charleston , saying i confess i know not whether i shall go to or from the enemy .
he arrived in charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city 's defenses .
he immediately ran into a problem the south carolina troops militia or the colonial regiments were not on the continental line , and thus not formally under his authority .
some south carolina troops resisted his instructions , and rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming lee in command of all south carolina forces .
square shaped fort sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from palmetto logs CD feet CD CD m high and CD feet CD CD m wide .
the walls were filled with sand , and rose CD feet CD CD m above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted .
a hastily erected palisade of thick planks helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls .
an assortment of CD cannon , ranging from CD and CD pounders to a few british CD pounders and french CD pounders , dotted the front and rear walls .
general lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a slaughter pen .
president rutledge refused , and specifically ordered colonel moultrie to obey lee in everything , except in leaving fort sullivan .
moultrie 's delaying tactics so angered lee that he decided on june CD that he would replace moultrie .
the battle began the next day before he could do so .
lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to haddrell 's point .
the british fleet weighed anchor at cape fear on may CD , and arrived outside charleston harbor the next day .
moultrie noticed a british scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby long island now known as the isle of palms , just a few CD yards from sullivan 's island .
troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of sullivan 's .
by june CD , most of the british fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in five fathom hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance .
with the fort on sullivan 's island only half complete , admiral parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls .
the british fleet was composed of CD man of war ships the flagship CD gun bristol , as well as the CD gun experiment and frigates actaeon , active , solebay , siren , sphinx , friendship and the bomb vessel thunder , in total mounting nearly CD cannon .
the army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th regiments of foot , and part of the 46th .
on june CD , clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms .
however , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it which was flying a truce flag , and it was not delivered until the next day .
that same day , clinton began landing CD CD troops on long island .
the intent was that these troops would wade across the channel now known as breach inlet between long and sullivan 's , which the british believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded fort sullivan .
general lee responded to the british landing with several actions .
he began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the british were intending to launch an attack directly on charleston .
he also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly CD mile CD CD km channel separating the island from charleston .
the unwillingness of moultrie and rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role .
the americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of sullivan 's island , which was manned by more than CD men and CD small cannons , and began to fortify a guard post at haddrell 's point on the mainland opposite fort sullivan .
general clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on june CD .
an attempt to wade the channel between the CD islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition .
he considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the americans , with timely advice from general lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the long island position .
as a result , the british and american forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range .
clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have the glory of being defeated alone .
the attack was originally planned for june CD , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off for several days .
on the morning of june CD , fort sullivan was defended by colonel moultrie , commanding the 2nd south carolina regiment and a company of the 4th south carolina artillery , numbering CD men .
at around CD CD am that morning , a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack .
less than an hour later , CD warships had sailed into positions facing the fort .
thunder and friendship anchored about CD CD miles CD CD km from the fort while parker took active , bristol , experiment and solebay to a closer position about CD yards CD m from sullivan 's island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort .
each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire .
although many of thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect .
according to moultrie , we had a morass in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried .
thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short lived .
she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the overloading of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts .
owing to shortage of gunpowder , moultrie 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons .
they also fired in small volleys , CD cannon at a time .
CD british observer wrote , their fire was surprisingly well served and it was slow , but decisive indeed .
they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed .
general clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of sullivan 's island .
assisted by CD sloops of war , the flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under fire from colonel william thomson 's defenses .
facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire , clinton abandoned the attempt .
around noon the frigates sphinx , syren , and actaeon were sent on a roundabout route , avoiding some shoals , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform and also cover CD of the main escape routes from the fort .
however , all CD ships grounded on an uncharted sandbar , and the riggings of actaeon and sphinx became entangled in the process .
the british managed to refloat sphinx and syren , but acteon remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged sandbar .
consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of good fortune not lost on colonel moultrie had these CD ships effected their purpose , they would have enfiladed us in such a manner , as to have driven us from our guns .
at the fort , moultrie ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the CD large man of war ships , bristol and experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns .
chain shot fired at bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main and mizzenmasts .
CD round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding parker in the knee and thigh .
the shot also tore off part of his britches , leaving his backside exposed .
by mid afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended .
however , lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the british ships .
lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling colonel moultrie , i see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , i will go up to the town again .
admiral parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside cannonades .
this strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions .
the structure would quiver , and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering .
the exchange continued until around CD CD pm , when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range .
at CD point during the battle , the flag moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down .
sergeant william jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again , holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided .
he was credited by moultrie with reviving the troops spirits , and later given commendations for bravery .
a painting of this event pictured above depicts jasper 's actions .
counting casualties , parker reported CD sailors killed and CD wounded aboard bristol , which was hit more than CD times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging .
experiment was also badly damaged with CD sailors killed and CD wounded .
active and solebay reported CD casualties each .
the americans reported their casualties at only CD killed and CD wounded .
the following morning , the british , unable to drag the grounded acteon off the sandbar , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands .
patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons at the british ships , took what stores and loot they could , and retreated shortly before the ship 's powder magazine exploded .
the british did not attempt to take the fort again .
within days of the battle , charlestonians learned of the signing of the declaration of independence in philadelphia .
the british troops were reembarked on their transports , and on july CD the british fleet withdrew northward to help the main british army in its campaign against new york city .
to add insult to injury , CD of the british transports grounded off long island and was captured by patriot forces .
the british did not return to charleston until CD , when general clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army .
until the south again became a focus of the war in late CD , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort .
admiral parker and general clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition 's failures .
although clinton was not blamed by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and parker was lauded for his personal bravery .
fort sullivan was renamed fort moultrie shortly after the battle to honor colonel william moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of charleston .
extensively modified in the years after the battle , it was supplanted by fort sumter as the principal defense of charleston prior to the outbreak of the american civil war .
in CD , to celebrate the centennial , companies from savannah , augusta , macon , columbia , new york and boston were invited to charleston .
the site was turned over to the national park service in CD , and is now part of fort sumter national monument .
a small monument to the battle of sullivan 's island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where general clinton 's soldiers had hoped to cross .
the monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement .
CD iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by colonel moultrie .
commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle .
despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense and famously raised during victory .
it came to be known as the moultrie flag or liberty flag .
when charleston lost to the british in the CD siege was reclaimed by american forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by general nathanael greene .
hu zhengyan chinese .
c .
CD CD was a chinese artist , printmaker and publisher .
he worked in calligraphy , traditional chinese painting , and seal carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work .
hu lived in nanjing during the transition from the ming dynasty to the qing dynasty .
a ming loyalist , he was offered a position at the rump court of the hongguang emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office .
he did , however , design the hongguang emperor 's personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor 's capture and death in CD .
he owned and operated an academic publishing house called the ten bamboo studio , in which he practised various multi colour printing and embossing techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise .
hu 's work at the ten bamboo studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking , leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form .
hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled the ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy , an artist 's primer which remained in print for around CD years .
his studio also published seal catalogues , academic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing papers .
many of these were edited and prefaced by hu and his brothers .
hu was born in xiuning county , anhui province in CD or early CD .
both his father and elder brother zhengxin , art name wusuo , were physicians , and after he turned CD he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around lu'an and huoshan .
it is commonly stated that zhengyan himself was also a doctor , though the earliest sources attesting to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century .
by CD , hu had moved to nanjing where he lived with his wife wu .
their home on jilongshan , now also known as beiji ge , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting house for like minded artists .
hu named it the ten bamboo studio shizhuzhai , , after the CD bamboo plants that grew in front of the property .
it functioned as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed CD artisans including his CD brothers zhengxin and zhengxing , art name zizhu , and his sons qipu and qiyi , courtesy name .
during hu 's lifetime , the ming dynasty , which had ruled china for over CD years , was overthrown and replaced by china 's last imperial dynasty , the qing .
following the fall of the capital beijing in CD , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a ming loyalist regime in nanjing with zhu yousong on the throne as the hongguang emperor .
hu , who was noted for his seal carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new emperor .
the court offered him the position of drafter for the secretariat zhongshu sheren , as a reward , but he did not accept the role although he did accord himself the title of zhongshu sheren in some of his subsequent personal seals .
according to wen ruilin 's lost history of the south nanjiang yishi , , prior to the qing invasion of nanjing hu studied at the national university there , and whilst a student was employed by the ministry of rites to record official proclamations .
he produced the imperial promotion of minor learning qin ban xiaoxue , and the record of displayed loyalty biaozhong ji , as part of this work .
as a result , he was promoted to the ministry of personnel and gained admittance to the hanlin academy , but before he could take up this appointment , beijing had fallen to the manchu rebellion .
since contemporaneous biographies wen 's work was not published until CD make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after hu 's death .
hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in CD , after the end of the ming dynasty .
xiao yuncong and lü liuliang recorded visiting him during his later years , in CD and CD respectively .
he died in poverty at the age of CD , sometime around late CD or early CD .
hu zhengyan was a noted seal carver , producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries .
his style was rooted in the classical seal script of the han dynasty , and he followed the huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary he zhen .
hu 's calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear compositional structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed .
huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other huizhou artists hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals .
hu 's work was known outside his local area .
in CD , hu took it upon himself to create a new imperial seal for the hongguang emperor , which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer .
he presented his creation with an essay , the great exhortation of the seal dabao zhen , , in which he bemoaned the loss of the chongzhen emperor 's seal and begged heaven 's favour in restoring it .
hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming , equally footed couplets pianti , used in the imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the southern ming court .
despite his reputation as an artist and seal carver , hu was primarily a publisher .
his publishing house , the ten bamboo studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art .
medical textbooks .
books on etymology and phonetics .
and copies of as well as commentaries on the confucian classics .
unlike other publishers in the area , the ten bamboo studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels .
this bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location the mountain on which hu took up residence was just to the north of the nanjing guozijian national academy , which provided a captive market for academic texts .
between CD and CD , the ten bamboo studio produced over CD printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience .
the studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , tested prescriptions for myriad illnesses wanbing yanfang , was published in CD and proved popular enough to be reissued CD years later .
hu 's brother zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books .
during the 1630s the ten bamboo studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the ming .
these included the imperial ming record of loyalty huang ming biaozhong ji , , a biography of loyal ming officials , and the edicts of the imperial ming huang ming zhaozhi , , a list of imperial proclamations .
after the fall of the ming dynasty , hu renamed the studio the hall rooted in the past digutang , as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the CD bamboo imprint continued to be used .
despite hu 's withdrawal from society after CD , the studio continued to publish well into the qing dynasty , for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing hu 's carving work .
the ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in china .
at his studio , hu zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing , creating processes for producing multi coloured prints and embossed printed designs .
as a result , he was able to produce some of china 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as assorted block printing douban yinshua , .
this system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour .
it was a lengthy , painstaking process , requiring CD to CD engraved printing blocks and up to CD inkings and impressions to create a single image .
hu also employed a related form of multiple block printing called set block printing taoban yinshua , , which had existed since the yuan period some CD years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again .
he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing .
this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible .
in some images , hu employed a blind embossing technique known as embossed designs gonghua , or embossed blocks gongban , , using an uninked , imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper .
he used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants .
this was a relatively new process , having been invented by hu 's contemporary wu faxiang , who was also a nanjing based publisher .
wu had used this technique for the first time in his book wisteria studio letter paper luoxuan biangu jianpu , , published in CD .
both hu and wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a sideline income for the ten bamboo studio .
hu 's most notable work is the ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy shizhuzhai shuhuapu , , an anthology of around CD prints by around CD different artists including hu himself , published in CD .
it consists of CD sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit .
some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes .
as well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic primer , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy .
although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to chinese painting .
in this book , hu used his multiple block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps .
the manual is bound in the butterfly binding hudie zhuang , style , whereby whole folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double page spread .
this binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image .
cambridge university library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in august , CD .
said charles aylmer , head of the cambridge university chinese department , the binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was digitized , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it despite its undoubted importance to scholars .
the popularity of the ten bamboo studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late qing dynasty .
hu also produced the work ten bamboo studio letter paper shizhuzhai jianpu , , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the gonghua stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief .
whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects .
the book was bound in the wrapped back baobei zhuang , style , in which the folio pages are folded , stacked , and sewn along the open edges .
originally published in CD , it was reissued in CD volumes between CD and CD by zheng zhenduo and lu xun , and revised and republished again in CD .
with his brother zhengxin , hu edited a new introductory edition of the confucian classics , entitled the standardised text of the four books , identified and corrected sishu dingben bianzheng , CD , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text .
a similar approach was taken with the essentials of the thousand character classic in CD scripts qianwen liushu tongyao , CD , which hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , li deng .
it was published after li 's death , partly in homage to him .
the CD hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary ye tingxiu , which was called simply the discussion of poetry shi tan , CD .
other works on poetry from the studio included helpful principles to the subtle workings of selected tang poems leixuan tang shi zhudao weiji , , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included colophons by hu zhengyan himself .
among the studio 's more obscure publications was a text on chinese dominoes entitled paitong fuyu , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by hu zhengyan .

spain had transformed from an ally of great britain in the war of the first coalition into an enemy in CD .
thus the presence of a powerful spanish squadron at manila posed a threat to the china fleet , an annual convoy of east indiaman merchant ships from macau in qing dynasty china to britain , which was of vital economic importance to britain .
to ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at macau in the winter of CD CD , the british commander in the east indies , rear admiral peter rainier , sent a convoy to china escorted by the frigates hms sybille and hms fox and commanded by captain edward cooke .
after completing his mission cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of spanish forces in manila himself .
he was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from manila , which would make a valuable prize .
sailing in sybille and accompanied by captain pulteney malcolm in fox , cooke reached the spanish capital on CD january CD .
anchored in manila bay , cooke pretended that his ships were french vessels and successfully lured successive boatloads of spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn .
capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack , cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting zamboanga before returning to macau .
in CD , after CD years of the french revolutionary wars , spain and the french republic signed the treaty of san ildefonso .
the secret terms of this treaty required spain to renounce its alliance with great britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally .
in the east indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant british forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the spanish philippines to the east .
britain dominated the east indies in CD , controlling the trade routes through the indian ocean from the ports of bombay , madras and calcutta .
dutch ceylon , the dutch cape colony and parts of the dutch east indies had been captured in CD , and the french presence in the region had been confined to de france and a few subsidiary islands in the western indian ocean .
some of the most important trade routes began at canton and macau in qing dynasty china .
early in each year a large convoy known as the china fleet , composed of large east indiaman merchant ships in the employ of the british east india company , sailed westwards to europe from macau laden with tea and other commercial cargo .
this convoy was economically significant to britain CD convoy in CD was valued at over CD CD the equivalent of CD CD CD as of CD .
in january CD the convoy had been attacked by the french squadron in the east indies , comprising CD frigates commanded by contre amiral pierre césar charles de sercey .
in the ensuing bali strait incident the commander deceived sercey into believing that the unescorted convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the french admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to de france .
there was considerable concern in india that sercey might try again in CD , or that the spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at cavite , might make an attempt of their own .
rainier 's initial impulse on learning in november CD of the impending declaration of war between britain and spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the philippines , centred on manila in repetition of the successful british capture of manila in CD .
britain now faced france and spain alone , while emissaries from the tipu sultan of the kingdom of mysore , an old opponent of britain in southern india , were seeking french assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities .
the resources planned for the operation against manila were therefore retained in india and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the china fleet was still essential and rainier diverted some of his squadron eastwards to china .
a number of merchant ships had gathered at bombay in the spring of CD in preparation for the trip to macau to load trade goods and join the china fleet .
the convoy arrived without incident on CD december CD , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses .
with his convoy safely at anchor in macau and the china fleet several weeks from sailing , cooke decided to reconnoitre manila and make observations on the port and the spanish squadron based there .
as an added motivation , rumours in macau suggested that the annual manila galleon was due to arrive .
this ship brought up to CD CD spanish silver dollars from acapulco across the pacific ocean stopping at guam on its way to manila .
depositing its dollars in the philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the east indies for the return journey to new spain .
this round trip was essential to the maintenance of the spanish empire in the east indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only mitigated by the substantial subsidy from new spain .
spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the east indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade .
but british sailors had nevertheless been attacking the manila galleons since thomas cavendish in CD .
leaving the heavier warships at macau , cooke sailed on CD january CD only with sybille and fox , the latter carrying a mr. bernard , an experienced linguist .
passing luzon , cooke 's ships encountered a small spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying french tricolors .
seizing the spanish vessel , cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the spanish squadron in manila were undergoing extensive repairs at cavite and were unfit to sail .
cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove CD CD silver dollars .
the spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in april CD and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time cooke 's small squadron arrived off manila .
cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as french vessels , modelling sybille on the powerful CD gun forte and fox on the smaller prudente .
late in the afternoon of CD january CD , sybille and fox arrived in manila bay , slipping unchallenged past the fortress of corregidor and then sailing across the bay on the morning of CD january , anchoring between manila and cavite .
from his vantage point cooke could see the spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in cavite , the ships of the line san pedro , europa and montañés and the frigates maria de la cabeya and luisa in dock and unfit for action .
to cooke 's disappointment he could also see the manila galleon , marquesetta being unloaded at the cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship rey carlos aground in the harbour .
the spanish had learned only shortly before cooke 's arrival that the british frigate hms resistance under captain edward pakenham was in philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack .
fox was the first british ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the guardboat , whose crew came aboard .
malcolm , like cooke , spoke french fluently and with bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new arrivals were forte and prudente seeking supplies and spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations .
the officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the spanish ships would be in a position to sail until march at the earliest .
cooke then joined the party on the deck of fox , claiming to be commodore latour , a french officer who , unknown to the spanish , had been killed in the action of CD september CD off sumatra .
the spanish officer was now completely convinced by the ruse , which had been augmented by fake french uniforms .
inviting the visitor below decks , cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of toasts , including the downfall of england .
for an hour the officers drank , malcolm and cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside fox containing more officers keen to greet the french arrivals .
this vessel was the personal barge of the spanish commander at cavite , rear admiral don ignacio maría de , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat .
each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war .
in malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the british frigates sailed , and offered more wine .
the crew of fox meanwhile forced the captured spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing .
climbing into the spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby pasig river , where they had learned that CD heavy gunboats were moored .
taking the crews by surprise , the british boarding parties drove off the spanish without a fight and brought all CD boats alongside fox .
these vessels normally carried crews of CD and were well armed , CD with a CD pounder long gun and CD with CD pounder long guns , each supplemented by CD swivel guns .
the harbour captain reached fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned .
malcolm received him with a tirade of near incomprehensible french and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks .
shortly afterwards , at CD CD , cooke and malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and grog to the crew , the total number of spanish sailors on fox now numbering approximately CD .
once the meal was finished , cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats .
cooke led his small squadron past corregidor on CD january and turned south .
CD days later in a storm CD of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again , lost with its CD crew .
the frigates subsequently scouted mindanao before reaching zamboanga on CD january .
there cooke raised spanish colours in an attempt to deceive the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but sybille grounded on a sandbank at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a guardboat sent by the governor of zamboanga , raymundo españold .
the captain of the spanish boat asked the british ships the names of their captains , and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire , he put the town on alert .
with the defenders forewarned , cooke abandoned his ruse and after refloating sybille the following morning , ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour .
this had little effect , though later the spanish recovered at least CD cannonballs from different calibers , and malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the landward side of the fort .
the boats came under heavy fire , CD smashed by a cannonball , killing CD and wounding CD .
another boat grounded on a sandbar and became stuck .
so with his force in disarray , as CD villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the british from the beach , malcolm called off the operation .
after exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range , with CD dead and CD wounded on sybille and CD wounded on fox , in addition to those lost in the boats .
the defenders lost a single man killed and CD wounded .
with his frigates now requiring repairs , cooke withdraw half a league from zamboanga and spent CD days refitting the masts and rigging of the ships .
then he sailed north , scuttling the CD remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to canton .
CD days later , on CD january the squadron halted at a village named pullock in the north of the sultanate of maguindanao to collect fresh water .
on the beach a boat party from sybille was set upon by lumad tribesmen .
CD were killed and CD others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive .
cooke complained to sultan kibab sahriyal at kuta wato and the captured sailors were eventually recovered , although not before sybille and fox had sailed for china to escort the merchant convoy back to india .
cooke 's opportunistic diversion had determined that the spanish forces in the philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost CD lives admiral rainier later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the admiralty .
more might have been achieved with reinforcements historian c. northcote parkinson suggests that had cooke 's squadron united with resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed spanish warships at cavite .
he also notes however that in this scenario pakenham would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and guile than cooke .
historian richard woodman was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have no glorious outcome and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short coming .
the CD china fleet sailed without further incident .
during the ensuing year resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in july in the bangka strait , and the majority of rainier 's forces were focused on disrupting the french occupation of suez in the red sea .
this diversion of british resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and sercey was able to send the frigate preneuse and corvette brûle gueule to manila late in the year to join the repaired spanish squadron .
at the beginning of february CD , this combined force sailed to macau , taking the british defences by surprise .
the british commander captain william hargood counterattacked , advancing on the franco spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the wanshan archipelago .
the combined squadron then dispersed and the china fleet was not attacked again until the battle of pulo aura in CD , at which a french squadron was again driven off in confusion .
the frigates cooke had mimicked , forte and prudente were sent to operate independently against british trade in the indian ocean in early CD .
prudente was captured by hms daedalus at the action of CD february CD near southern africa , and forte was intercepted by hms sybille under cooke on CD february near balasore in bengal .
in the ensuing battle forte was captured but cooke mortally wounded , dying on CD may .
b of the bang was a sculpture by thomas heatherwick next to the city of manchester stadium in manchester , england , which was commissioned to mark the CD commonwealth games .
it was CD of the tallest structures in manchester and the tallest sculpture in the uk until the completion of aspire in CD .
it was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the leaning tower of pisa .
the sculpture took its name from a quotation of british sprinter linford christie , in which he said that he started his races not merely at the bang of the starting pistol , but at the b of the bang .
the sculpture was commissioned in CD .
construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until CD january CD .
CD days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first of CD visible structural problems as the tip of CD of the spikes detached and fell to the ground .
legal action started a year later , resulting in an out of court settlement totalling CD CD CD .
in february CD , manchester city council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage .
despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal .
the core was sold for scrap in july CD , while the CD spikes remain in storage .
b of the bang originally stood CD metres CD ft tall with CD hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core .
it was angled at CD degrees and supported by CD CD m CD ft long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes CD m CD ft above the ground .
the sculpture weighed CD tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weighing over CD CD tonnes , including a CD m2 CD CD sq ft reinforced concrete slab .
the foundations are CD m CD ft deep .
the sculpture was made from the same weathering steel also known as cor ten as the angel of the north sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements .
this layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water .
as part of the design , the spikes swayed slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of CD mph CD km h .
at the time of construction a time capsule was placed in CD of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened circa CD .
the location of the time capsule after dismantling is currently unknown .
b of the bang was located next to the city of manchester stadium at sportcity , in beswick , at the corner of alan turing way and ashton new road .
. it took its name from a quotation of british sprinter linford christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the bang of the starting pistol , but at the b of the bang .
the artwork had been nicknamed kerplunk by the locals after the popular children 's game from the 1970s .
prior to the construction of aspire at the university of nottingham , b of the bang was britain 's tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the angel of the north , which stands at CD feet CD m .
it was designed to look like an exploding firework and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the leaning tower of pisa .
it was commissioned by new east manchester limited to commemorate the CD commonwealth games .
the design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in CD and was designed by thomas heatherwick .
the sculpture was constructed in sheffield by thomas heatherwick studio , packman lucas , flint and neill and westbury structures .
it was approved at the start of CD , with the central core arriving in manchester on CD june CD .
this was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort .
this central core was lifted into place in august CD , after which the CD spikes could begin being attached .
early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of july CD , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname g of the bang .
the official unveiling by linford christie took place on CD january CD .
in total the sculpture cost CD CD CD to design and construct twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs .
funding was sourced from a european regional development fund contribution of CD CD , the north west development agency , contributing CD CD , and manchester city council providing CD CD .
the tip of CD of the CD CD CD CD CD ft spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on CD january CD , only CD days before the official unveiling .
after inspection , the event went ahead as planned .
CD months later , in may CD , a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose .
at that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed .
as a result , some of the joints were re welded , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement .
this consisted of retrofitting tip weights to CD of the spikes weights .
despite these modifications , b of the bang remained fenced off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to get it sorted .
in may CD a total of CD spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel .
it was announced in october CD that manchester city council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture .
in november CD this culminated in an out of court settlement being reached between manchester city council , the project 's designers thomas heatherwick studio ltd , and the engineering and construction subcontractors packman lucas ltd , flint and neill partnership and westbury structures ltd .
the agreement was to pay the council 1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence .
acting on a report in january CD , the city council recommended that b of the bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement .
the report recognised the sculpture 's aesthetic value for manchester and manchester city council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long term solution .
CD possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre , although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing .
in january CD , antony gormley , creator of the angel of the north to which b of the bang is often compared spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , it is a great tribute to manchester that this ground breaking work was commissioned .
to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council 's nerve .
despite gormley 's plea , removal of b of the bang began in april CD .
more substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm connell brothers limited began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment .
although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture 's return , and in early july CD the core was sold as scrap for CD CD .
the battle of the hongorai river took place during the second world war and involved australian , new zealand and japanese forces .
part of the wider bougainville campaign of the pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of bougainville island .
coming after the battle of slater 's knoll in which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in CD distinct periods between CD april and CD may CD , as elements of the australian 15th brigade advanced south along the buin road .
the initial phase saw the australians advance towards the hongorai river .
following the end of the early fighting , the australian advance towards the main japanese concentration at buin continued as they struck out towards the hari and mivo rivers .
this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , washing away many bridges and roads upon which the australians relied for supplies .
as the australian advance stalled , the japanese began harassing the australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late july and into august , the australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards buin again .
ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end .
japanese forces had landed on bougainville in early CD , capturing it from the small force of australians garrisoning the island .
they had subsequently developed several airbases on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern solomon islands and to attack the allied lines of communication between the united states , australia and the southwest pacific area .
these bases also helped protect rabaul , the major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea , and throughout CD , allied planners determined that bougainville was vital for neutralising the japanese base around rabaul .
us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape torokina , on the western coast of the island , north of empress augusta bay , in november CD .
after an initial counter attack , the us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around torokina , establishing a strong perimeter .
in march CD , the japanese launched a heavy counter attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties .
after this , the situation on bougainville became largely static , as the japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around torokina .
in late CD , as part of plans to free us troops up for the philippines campaign , the australian ii corps consisting of mainly militia troops under the command of lieutenant general stanley savige took over responsibility for allied operations on bougainville from the american xiv corps .
australian forces began arriving on the island between november and december CD , initially establishing themselves around the us base at torokina .
however , allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of japanese on the island at this time was closer to CD CD .
the campaign that australian planners developed entailed CD separate drives in the north , it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into the narrow bonis peninsula and contained .
in the centre the seizure of pearl ridge would give the australians control of the east west avenues of approach , as well as affording them protection against further counter attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast .
and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the japanese forces were concentrated around buin .
following the capture of pearl ridge in december CD , the australian 7th brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards buin .
in late march and early april CD , they had fought the battle of slater 's knoll after which a brief lull followed as the australians paused to shorten their supply lines .
meanwhile , the survivors of the japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the hongorai river .
the australian 3rd division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the hari river , while the hongorai was also included as an intermediate objective .
japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the australians at about CD CD men , of which CD CD were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd division .
the 15th brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the australian units on bougainville at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th brigade , which was in need of rest .
the 58th 59th infantry battalion took over responsibility for slater 's knoll replacing the 25th infantry battalion while the 24th infantry battalion took up a position across the buin road .
further inland , the CD 8th commando squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank .
the japanese forces opposing the australians belonged to the 6th division , under the command of lieutenant general tsutomu akinaga .
akinaga had been ordered to delay the australian advance between the hongorai and the hari for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the australian 's expected line of advance .
the division 's infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around slater 's knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated .
the front line positions were assigned to the 6th field artillery regiment , while the 13th infantry regiment was to hold CD strongpoints to their rear along and astride the buin road , designated a through to e .
the 6th field and 4th field heavy artillery regiments both held strongpoints further back , designated f and g .
the 23rd infantry regiment was placed in the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on slater 's knoll .
the 15th brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th brigade on CD april .
CD days later , hammer received the order to commence the advance towards the hongorai from savige , who offered him the support of the 29th brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter attack .
in a change to the tactics that the australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around slater 's knoll , from early may they advanced on a CD battalion front , instead of CD .
the 24th infantry battalion was in the van , moving along the buin road with the 58th 59th protecting its flank and rear .
while CD CD yd CD CD m further inland the 57th 60th infantry battalion , commencing on CD may , advanced along the commando road from rumiki , after taking over from the 9th infantry battalion .
moving forward under a creeping barrage as they moved beyond tokinotu , the 24th infantry battalion was the first to contact the japanese , carrying out an attack against japanese positions around dawe 's creek on CD april .
the left forward company d company reached its objective without trouble .
however , c company on the right along with the troop of tanks came up against stiff japanese resistance and became bogged down .
a company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the hatai track .
in support of a company , matilidas came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the undergrowth to reveal several japanese pillboxes , which were destroyed by the australian armour .
as night fell , c company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning .
engineers were brought forward , as was a bulldozer , and the gap was bridged .
amidst heavy fighting , the australians forced their way across the creek .
by the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation CD yd CD m beyond the creek , CD japanese had been killed for the loss of CD australians killed and CD wounded .
after this , the australians continued their advance towards sindou creek , which was a further CD CD CD CD km to the southeast .
in response , the japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back .
further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on CD april .
resuming their advance , the australians were supported by CD squadrons of corsairs from the royal new zealand air force nos. CD , CD and CD squadrons which bombed and strafed the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire .
with such strong support the japanese offered little resistance and over the course of CD days the 24th infantry battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the hongorai , for just CD man wounded .
further progress was made over the next week , but on CD may the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices .
the japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also .
to negate the effectiveness of the australian tanks , the japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support .
additionally , the japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire .
meanwhile , the previous day , CD may , the 57th 60th infantry battalion had begun operating along the parallel commando road to the north .
here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed .
they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on CD may .
on CD may , along the buin road , the 24th infantry battalion had pressed forward again .
advancing with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately CD japanese .
after the lead matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew .
moving around the stricken tank , the second matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the japanese defenders from the position .
that night , the japanese artillery opened up on the australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company sized counter attack .
the fighting lasted for over CD and a half hours , but when it was over the australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack .
in doing so , they suffered CD killed and CD wounded , while the attacking japanese had suffered heavily , losing CD men killed .
it was the biggest loss since the action at slater 's knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the hongorai .
after this , the australians were able to resume their advance to the river on CD may without further opposition .
the previous CD weeks in which they had advanced CD CD yd CD CD m to the hongorai had been costly for them , however , with the australian 24th infantry battalion losing CD killed and CD wounded .
against this , the japanese had lost at least CD killed .
following the advance to the hongorai , there was a pause of about a week as the australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the hongorai en masse .
this allowed savige to re evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the hari and mivo rivers .
as they waited for the advance to resume , the australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time .
as a part of these , the 24th infantry battalion sent a company across the hongorai and subsequently located a strong japanese position on a feature that became known as egan 's ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main australian axis of advance .
preliminary moves began before this , and on CD may a platoon from the 24th infantry battalion along with CD tanks attempted to carry out an attack on egan 's ridge .
after CD of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw .
meanwhile , the rnzaf corsair squadrons now reinforced by no. CD squadron began an CD day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the buin and commando roads .
during this period , the new zealanders flew CD sorties , while artillery and mortars fired thousands of rounds .
CD days later , on CD may , the 57th 60th infantry battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the hongorai inland and advancing along the commando road with CD corsairs and CD batteries of artillery in support .
crossing CD yd CD m north of the ford , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing .
nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on CD may .
in the centre , the main attack along the buin road began at CD CD on CD may after CD minutes of strafing by new zealand corsairs had prepared the ground .
advancing under a creeping barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th infantry battalion moved forward with CD companies up front and CD held back in reserve , along with CD troops of matilda tanks .
mostly the forward companies reached their objectives , but CD of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing CD killed and CD wounded .
the attack was resumed the following day , and the australians were able to advance to the pororei ford .
however , they were prevented from moving any further as the japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an australian patrol encountered CD japanese and were forced to go to ground .
finally , a company from the 24th infantry battalion was able to move on to the high ground on egan 's ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped .
engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature .
on the right flank , the 58th 59th infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the hongorai by bulldozer .
beginning their move CD days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the japanese .
meanwhile , using tractors to drag the tanks through the mud , the australian armour had crossed the river also and by CD CD on CD may the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , unbeknown to the japanese .
the following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance .
later , after CD of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a CD mm gun and a large amount of ammunition .
by CD may , although there were still a number of japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the australian objectives had been secured and mopping up operations began .
the last remaining defensive location before the hongorai was egan 's ridge , where the japanese were sheltering in tunnels .
a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge .
it was subsequently occupied by a company of australian infantry .
within a short period of time the buin road was subsequently opened , providing the australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the hari , mobiai , and mivo rivers .
the final phase of the battle cost the japanese CD killed , while the australians lost CD killed and CD wounded .
during the course of the fighting around the hongorai , the australians lost CD men killed and CD wounded , while the japanese lost at least CD men killed .
following the battle , the australians continued their advance towards buin at the southern end of the island .
throughout the remainder of the month and into june , the 15th brigade advanced along the buin road , crossing the hari on CD june .
beyond the river , the japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep entrenchments .
these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th brigade subsequently crossed mobiai river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson 's 29th brigade in early july .
as the 29th brigade advanced toward the mivo river , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt .
the height of the river rose CD metres CD CD ft .
the buin road was reduced , in the words of gavin long , to a sea of mud and many of the bridges upon which the australian supply system was dependent were washed away .
this rendered large scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the australians even ceased patrolling operations across the mivo .
meanwhile , the japanese continued to harass the australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the australian line of communications .
on CD july , the 15th infantry battalion fought off a series of attacks around siskatekori , at the junction of the mivo river and the buin road , which included a heavy japanese artillery bombardment .
australian patrols were resumed in late july and continued into august .
these attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding .
fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards buin continued into august , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed .
as a result , the final australian operations on bougainville took place on the ratsua front in the northern sector , where the australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at porton plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the bonis peninsula .
by mid august , however , following the dropping of CD atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations .
following the end of the war , the australian army awarded CD battle honours for the fighting around the hongorai river .
the CD 4th armoured regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th 60th and 58th 59th infantry battalions received the battle honour hongorai river .
sonic the hedgehog is a platform video game developed by sonic team and published by sega for the sega genesis console .
the game was first released in north america , europe and australia in june CD , and in japan the following month .
the game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named sonic in a quest to defeat dr. robotnik , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical chaos emeralds .
sonic the hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button .
the game 's development began in CD , when sega ordered its am8 development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company .
after considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue hedgehog with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves sonic team to match their character .
sonic the hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of super mario series creator , shigeru miyamoto .
sonic the hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , yuji naka .
the game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of gameplay .
the game was also commercially successful , establishing the genesis as a key player in the CD bit era and allowing it to compete with nintendo and their super nes console .
it has been ported a number of times , and inspired several clones , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media .
in an attempt to steal the CD chaos emeralds and harness their power , the game 's antagonist , dr. ivo robotnik , has trapped the animal inhabitants of south island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules .
the player controls sonic , who aims to halt robotnik 's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself .
if the player collects all the chaos emeralds and completes the game , a reward ending sequence is shown .
if all the emeralds are not collected , robotnik taunts the player while juggling the chaos emeralds instead .
sonic the hedgehog is a 2d , side scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around sonic 's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop the loops .
the levels contain hazards in the form of robots badniks in the western game manuals inside of which dr. robotnik has trapped animals .
although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game .
the player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into bottomless pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents .
sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly damaging enemies and some obstacles .
this can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground .
scattered around each level map are gold rings , and collecting CD rings rewards the player with an extra life .
rings are a layer of protection against hazards .
if sonic has at least CD ring when he collides with an enemy or obstacle , he will survive .
however , all his rings will be scattered .
they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again .
if sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life .
although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection , certain hazards such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time will cost sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection .
the game is divided into CD zones green hill , marble , spring yard , labyrinth , star light , and scrap brain , each with its own visual style and enemies .
a player must navigate through each zone subdivided into CD acts to progress .
at the end of each zone 's third act , the player confronts dr. robotnik who pilots a different vehicle each time in a boss fight .
after the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the final zone for a last encounter with robotnik .
the player begins with CD lives power ups and rings add more , which are lost when sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects without rings , falls off screen or exceeds an act 's CD minute time limit .
lampposts acting as checkpoints allow sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life .
if he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life , the timer will reset to 0 CD when he returns to the checkpoint .
if all lives are lost at any point in the game , the game over screen will appear when the player can return to the beginning of the act with CD lives , if they have any continues .
when sonic reaches the end of act CD or act CD of a zone with at least CD rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a special stage a secret zone in the original genesis manual .
in each of CD special stages , sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack .
although the player earns a continue with each CD rings found , their main goal is to obtain the chaos emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a goal block which ends the level .
in CD , sega ordered its in house development studio , am8 , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company .
this was a position already held by the character alex kidd , but he was considered similar to mario and deemed unsatisfactory .
sega president hayao nakayama wanted a character as iconic as mickey mouse .
sega had competition from nintendo and its mascot , mario , in mind .
nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful super mario bros. CD , and sega wanted a foothold in the industry .
although the company had some success with genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough .
am8 developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics .
development emphasized speed , so am8 eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like kangaroos and squirrels .
CD idea , a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware .
the team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move .
designers then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on CD animals with spikes armadillos and hedgehogs .
the hedgehog character , first proposed by naoto ohshima , prevailed , although the armadillo would later become the basis for mighty the armadillo who first appeared in CD 's segasonic the hedgehog .
ohshima has admitted since that he created sonic 's basic design by combining felix the cat 's head with mickey mouse 's body .
sonic was originally teal colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the sega logo .
his shoes were colored red through the inspiration of michael jackson 's boots on the album cover for bad and the outfit of santa claus , whom ohshima saw as the most famous character in the world .
sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look sleeker , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping so attacking and jumping could be controlled with CD button .
the new character was originally named mr. needlemouse , but the CD member am8 changed his name to sonic and their studios to sonic team .
ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named madonna , but sega of america scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple .
sega of america also expressed concerns that most americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full scale recreation of the character , but compromised with sonic team to simply make design changes .
the antagonist ended up being named dr. eggman in japan and dr. robotnik in other regions as a result of a dispute between sega 's american and japanese divisions .
with a satisfying protagonist completed , sega turned to esteemed programmer yuji naka , who had impressed them through his work on phantasy star and the genesis port of ghouls n ghosts .
the gameplay originated with a tech demo by naka , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix .
naka 's prototype was a platform game with a fast moving character rolling in a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was fleshed out with ohshima 's character designs and levels by designer hirokazu yasuhara .
yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for CD months due to the delay of his planned move to the united states by the outbreak of the gulf war , but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year .
his designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design .
the game 's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist eizin suzuki , and the aesthetics of green hill were influenced by the geography of california .
in designing the game mechanics , naka was inspired by shigeru miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier .
admiring the simplicity of miyamoto 's mechanics in complex environments , naka decided that sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping .
he also wanted his creation to be more action oriented than the mario series .
while playing super mario bros. , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly .
due to the need to demonstrate the genesis technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over CD months .
the developers efforts were rewarded .
according to yuji naka , the game had the fastest ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console .
the team intended to add a CD player mode displayed via split screen , but naka 's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature .
however , such a mode would later appear in sequel sonic the hedgehog CD CD , where the second player would control sonic 's best friend miles tails prower .
naka , oshima , and yasuhara worked CD hours a day on the project for several months .
naka 's relationship with sega of japan was tenuous during this time .
he received little credit for his involvement in the game .
he left the company shortly after the game 's release , although sega of america hired him later .
before leaving , however , he defied sega of japan 's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background , identifiable only by looking at the game 's code .
the music for sonic the hedgehog was composed and produced by masato nakamura , bassist and lead songwriter of the j pop band dreams come true .
the game uses onboard yamaha ym2612 and sn76489 programmable sound generators to produce a variety of stereo sound effects and music .
it was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of sonic breakdancing to the music of a sonic band of sharps chicken on guitar , max monkey on bass , mach rabbit on drums , and vector the crocodile on keyboard .
the playable vector became a recurring character in the series , also appearing in knuckles chaotix , sonic heroes , and sonic free riders .
the development schedule scrapped the feature , and yuji naka replaced the test with the se ga
chant used in tv commercials which reportedly used CD eighth of the memory of the CD megabit cartridge .
on october CD , CD , CD years after the game 's release , a CD disc compilation of music from sonic the hedgehog and sonic the hedgehog CD was released in japan .
the first disc features original tracks from both games , the second contains masato nakamura 's demo recordings and the third comprises songs by dreams come true and their akon remixes .
game package illustrator akira watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters colorful , using clear lines and gradation to finish them neatly .
according to watanabe , the developers asked him to create a package design similar to pop art without being particular to conventional packages something original and stylish .
the game was released in north america , europe , and australia on june CD , CD , and in japan on july CD .
sega of america packaged it with american genesis consoles , replacing altered beast .
genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of sonic the hedgehog by mail .
sega of america created a large scale marketing campaign to promote the game and sonic as a mascot for the company .
a version of sonic the hedgehog was developed by ancient and released in CD for sega 's CD bit consoles , the master system and game gear .
its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the CD bit version , with different level themes and digital assets .
the level design is flatter , with no vertical loops , and sonic cannot re collect his rings after being hit .
the game has a different soundtrack , composed by chiptune musician yuzo koshiro and including his compositions and adaptations of music from the CD bit version .
it was the final game released for the master system in north america .
the master system version was re released for wii 's virtual console service in north america on august CD , CD , and in europe on august CD .
the game gear version was re released for the nintendo CD virtual console on june CD , CD , and included as an unlockable game in sonic adventure dx director 's cut for gamecube and windows and sonic mega collection plus for playstation CD , xbox , and windows .
a port , sonic the hedgehog genesis , was released for the game boy advance gba on november CD , CD in united states to mark the game 's fifteenth anniversary .
it included several new features , such as the ability to save game progress , a level select option , and an anniversary mode with the spin dash move not originally implemented until sonic the hedgehog CD .
its screen is slightly zoomed in , and adapted to the gba 's widescreen aspect ratio .
the game received poor reviews , with a metacritic score of CD percent .
the chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the game boy advance resulting in a slow frame rate , remixed chunky music , and poor preservation of the original gameplay .
with its sequels for the genesis , sonic the hedgehog has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers .
additionally , the game is an unlockable reward in the console versions of sonic generations .
sonic the hedgehog has been available for all CD major seventh generation video game consoles .
it was part of the wii virtual console at the service 's CD introduction , and was released for the xbox live arcade and playstation network shortly afterwards .
the game was released for the ipod classic , ipod video , and video capable ipod nano models in CD and for apple 's ios service compatible iphone and ipod touch models in april CD .
sonic the hedgehog became available on gametap in september CD .
in october CD , it was released as a microsoft windows download which was ported to steam .
the game was ported to CD online app services google play and the amazon appstore in december CD .
a remastered mobile port , created using christian whitehead 's retro engine previously used in the CD rerelease of sonic cd , was released on ios , replacing the original port , on may CD , CD with an android version released the following day .
the port features widescreen graphics , the optional ability to spin dash , a time attack mode , and the unlockable option to play as tails or knuckles the echidna .
the game was also released as part of the nintendo CD 3d classics line in may CD in japan , and worldwide in december .
sonic the hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews , with an CD percent approval rating at the review aggregator gamerankings based on CD reviews .
the game rivaled the mario series , particularly super mario world which was recently released for genesis rival super nintendo entertainment system .
paul rand of computer and video games compared the CD in depth and characterized sonic the hedgehog as being faster , with brighter colors , and super mario world as having more depth of play .
reviewers noted the game 's colorful , detailed graphics .
rand called its color scheme lively , but never garish , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the genesis .
reviewer boogie man of gamepro called the intricate backgrounds eye popping and gorgeous , which was echoed by mean machines .
according to the lessers hartley , patricia , and kirk of dragon , the graphics and animation in sonic the hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year and gamezone called the animation some of the smoothest and fastest ever seen .
the music and sound effects were also well received .
dragon called them great , and gamezone amazing .
rand noted stacks of catchy tunes and jingles , calling some of the sound effects absolutely brilliant .
although mean machines called the songs vaguely appealing , the game 's sound effects were better appreciated .
critics cited the fast gameplay , unprecedented in platformers .
gamepro 's boogie man noted its lightning fast action and , according to electronic gaming monthly egm , if you thought the enterprise was quick , wait till you see sonic at warp speed .
the game 's difficulty was disputed , described as impossible by rand and average by egm .
rand said about the gameplay in general that it plays like a dream .
according to gamezone it would enchant players for hours , and boogie man praised sonic team 's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping .
although egm , dragon , and paul of mean machines praised the level design especially the hidden rooms , paul found losing all of CD 's rings frustrating .
sonic the hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time .
frank provo of gamespot described the game as CD of the best platformers of all time , noting that despite technical issues in the game boy advance port after all these years , the underlying graphics , audio , and gameplay still hold up .
but the technical achievement impressed back in CD , and still does so today .
mega ranked the game its third favorite genesis title , and in CD game informer called it the 24th greatest game of all time .
sonic the hedgehog has been a commercial success .
the original genesis version sold over CD CD copies by february CD , and the mobile version had CD CD paid downloads by CD .
primarily because of its genesis bundling , sonic the hedgehog contributed to the console 's north american popularity .
during october december CD , the genesis outsold the super nes by a CD to CD ratio , and at its january CD peak claimed CD percent of the market for CD bit consoles .
although nintendo eventually again overtook sega , this was the first time since december CD that the company did not lead the console market .
sonic the hedgehog added speed and momentum based physics to the standard platform formula .
set pieces and mechanics introduced by the game such as loops , springs , and acceleration pads have appeared in other games and become associated with the sonic series .
a flood of animal with attitude platformers , each featuring a cartoon mascot , were released after sonic the hedgehog bubsy , aero the acro bat , james pond CD , earthworm jim , zero the kamikaze squirrel , awesome possum , ty the tasmanian tiger , gex .
this carried into the playstation era with games like punky skunk and crash bandicoot .
the game 's success led sega to develop an extensive media franchise .
a CD sequel , sonic the hedgehog CD , gave sonic a best friend and sidekick named miles tails prower and continued the fight against dr. robotnik .
sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters keeping sonic and robotnik as mainstays , surviving the end of sega console manufacturing after the dreamcast .
the series has ventured from platformers to fighting , racing , role playing , and sports games , and has expanded into anime and manga , cartoons and comic books , novels , and toys .
sonic the hedgehog has become CD of the best selling video game franchises of all time , with over CD CD copies sold by may CD .
the game 's first stage , green hill zone , has also been re purposed for use in several other titles such as sonic adventure CD , sonic generations and the super smash bros. series .
the same old story is the second episode of the first season of the american science fiction drama television series fringe .
the episode was written by executive producer jeff pinkner and co creators j. j. abrams , alex kurtzman , and roberto orci .
when developing the series , they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural .
the same old story was the first regular episode of fringe , and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series .
it was directed by paul a. edwards .
after a newborn baby rapidly ages into an CD year old man , fringe division agent olivia dunham anna torv and consultants peter joshua jackson and walter bishop john noble investigate .
they tie the case to the murders of young women , who have all had their pituitary glands removed .
it is revealed that dr. claus penrose mark blum , an expert in progeria , is working to help his son christopher derek cecil stay alive , as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome .
the same old story first aired in the united states on september CD , CD on fox .
an estimated CD CD CD viewers watched the episode , a CD percent increase from the series premiere .
the episode received mixed reviews from television critics reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances .
a prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital , dangerously in labor .
she dies as the doctors perform a caesarean section , but the child ages rapidly in minutes , soon dead having aged to the likes of an CD year old man .
olivia dunham anna torv , peter bishop joshua jackson , and walter bishop john noble , new members of the fringe division , are called to investigate by division head phillip broyles lance reddick , believing the case to be part of the pattern , a string of mysterious incidents .
the woman is identified as having recently left a local motel , and olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner john scott were not able to solve .
olivia explains to peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims , young women , then make an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material , killing the victim in the process .
walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth , her child having accelerated aging disease .
walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field , and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files .
once they are retrieved , olivia makes a connection to the pituitary gland which controls growth in humans , and informs charlie francis kirk acevedo to monitor recent cases where the victims pituitary gland has been removed .
olivia and peter turn to an expert in progeria , dr. penrose mark blum , to trying to learn more about rapid aging , but dr. penrose cannot help them further , though peter suspects he is hiding something .
unseen by the fringe division , dr. penrose visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer , christopher derek cecil , his son , who suffers from rapid aging syndrome .
penrose warns christopher to be careful and that they only need CD more woman to complete the process .
by this time , charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as olivia 's serial murderer .
at walter 's lab , they identify the pituitary gland has been removed .
they rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process .
walter hypothesizes they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman 's optical nerves induced by the paralyzing sedative .
borrowing an electronic pulse camera from massive dynamic , they discover the image of a suspension bridge near stoughton and identify the likely location from which it was viewed the same warehouse that dr. penrose visited .
the fbi converge on the building , and olivia and peter find penrose about to cut into another victim .
olivia chases off after christopher , who eventually succumbs to his rapid aging and dies , while peter , after nicking penrose with a bullet , confers with walter to apply a makeshift defibrillator to bring the victim back to life .
as they wrap up the case , olivia , peter , and walter complete forms to finalize their position in the fringe division .
when peter is out of earshot , walter learns from olivia that the fbi medical files on peter 's childhood are void of any details .
co creators j. j. abrams , alex kurtzman and roberto orci , and executive producer jeff pinkner wrote the episode .
paul a. edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series .
in developing fringe , the co creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at abrams television series alias .
they wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as law and order and csi crime scene investigation for inspiration .
kurztman explained , while we make sure that our episodes are self contained have a beginning , a middle , and an end the character stories can be serialized .
they do not have to resolve themselves over the course of CD show .
the same old story was fringe 's first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured .
the episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series different departments .
for the scene in which they remove the victim 's eyeball , the special effects crew created a mold based on actress elizabeth stanley 's head .
using plaster to make a prosthetic , they drilled out the eyeball and sculpt ed it open and went through a series of molds .
stanley stated that it is really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me , even though it is very gruesome because the eyeball 's popping out .
the prop department rigged a weapon which they called a photon gun .
according to prop master peter gelfman , this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people 's clothing for concealed weapons .
vfx supervisor christopher scollard explained that for the eye 's last vision , they used a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location , which they then used to take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab .
the same old story featured guest appearances by actors derek cecil as christopher penrose and mark blum as his father , dr. claus penrose .
other guest actors included betty gilpin as loraine amber daisy alcott , bernie mcinerney as old christopher penrose , carmen goodine as amy , ty jones as a doctor , and karin agstam as john scott 's sister .
the same old story was watched by CD CD CD viewers in the united states , a CD percent increase of CD CD from the pilot .
fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over CD years .
its high rated lead in , house , helped boost fringe 's ratings for the night , as CD percent of house 's total audience and CD percent of CD to CD year olds stayed to watch fringe .
fringe was also the highest rated program for male CD to CD year olds that evening .
the same old story received mixed reviews from television critics .
tv squad writer jane boursaw thought the episode seemed all over the place , and was not sure what to think .
travis fickett of ign thought it was better than the pilot .
though it was laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichéd dialogue , fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show .
fickett concluded his review by saying fringe has the potential to be a great show , and he also praised the production level as top notch , and torv 's performance as very good as she brings a unique presence to the show .
the a.v. club critic noel murray gave the episode a c , while television without pity graded it with a b.
josh jackson of paste magazine disliked the deus ex machina aspects that neatly solved the puzzles of the first CD episodes , and also criticized perceived plot contrivances like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim .
despite these flaws , jackson said he would tune in next week because he would rather have a show err on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable , and i am interested to see if abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve .
a ugo networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes , but after sitting down to watch fringe 's second episode , the same old story , my concerns have vanished .
fringe 's second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of fringe 's CD herbs and spices .
in fact , the subtle framework of what makes fringe not x files is even better defined in the first weekly episode .
i would struggled to find the word to describe it , and the winner is condensed .
the same old story has all of the sense of mystery , discovery , and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller , more combustible space .
another ugo writer , alex zalben , later compared the same old story to the similarly plotted the x files episode død kalm .
zalben concluded that fringe wins this one , just for having a slightly less stupid explanation .
the randy blythe manslaughter case was a court case in the czech republic , stemming from a CD lamb of god concert in prague , wherein CD year old fan daniel nosek sustained head injuries leading to a coma and subsequent death .
during the investigation , czech police unsuccessfully asked united states authorities for cooperation .

however , it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with blythe than nosek .
guitarist willie adler said , i cannot recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage .
i think i would have noticed something like that considering the dime thing .
according to blythe 's attorney martin radvan , the police launched an investigation following the death of nosek , about a month after the concert and following a coma .
after interviewing several eyewitnesses from the concert , the police asked the united states department of justice to take part in the investigation .

after this , the state attorney had CD working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint .
due to public holidays it was not until july CD , CD , that the state attorney filed his complaint , which was to be dealt with by appellate court , the prague municipal court .
on july CD , CD , prague municipal court 's panel of CD judges headed by judge luboš vrba overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to czk CD CD us CD CD .

jablonský gained fame as attorney of yekta uzunoglu , a kurdish national who was first charged in CD with preparing to commit CD murders and committing blackmail and torture .
it became CD of the longest criminal cases in the czech history , as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against uzunoglu until he was exonerated by the municipal court in prague in CD .
the court held that although the crimes did take place , there is no evidence that uzunoglu took part in it .
he was also defending judge pavel nagy , who was indicted of accepting a bribe .
the proceedings ended with nagy being found insane and criminally not liable .
jablonský also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a hairdresser of czech vips indicted on charges of rape and torture .
during the proceedings , the judge sent jablonský to face the disciplinary commission of the czech bar association for what he perceived as behaviour bordering on contempt .
the trial started on february CD , CD .
blythe testified that when he wanted to see the club before the concert , lamb of god 's technician told him that the club was terrible and messy .
according to blythe , the technician went on , saying that the stage was small , there were too many people , and that it was rather dangerous .
blythe , who is nearsighted , took off his glasses before entering the stage , which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half blind .
blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage .
CD of the fans , who was identified as milan pořádek by czech newspapers , and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings , managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security .
blythe testified that during the first attempt , pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving .
the second time , he tried to put his arms around blythe in an attempt to hug him .
blythe , who according to his own words perceived this as a danger , caught pořádek 's collar , pushed him on the ground , knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop .
he then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage , where the fan jumped off .
it was only after watching a video of the incident that blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back .
blythe further said that he saw pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security .
later , when another fan tried to climb the stage , blythe thought that it was pořádek again .
blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him , which it did not .
jiří choroš , author of video which caught the previous incidents with pořádek , testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him .
blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up .
blythe insisted that he never saw nosek nor came into contact with him .
it was not until the arrest CD years later that he found out about nosek 's death .
blythe further testified that he was not under the influence of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs .
chris adler , lamb of god 's drummer , testified that he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that blythe 's aggressiveness is only a stage act .
according to adler , blythe is a calm , moderate , and well read person .
the defense also presented videos from various lamb of god concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that blythe regularly cheers to the crowd , but not to encourage people to climb the stage .
blythe also alleged that after learning about nosek 's death , he had written a letter to the nosek family , in which he offered help and a meeting in person .
daniel nosek 's father , however , testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team .
nosek 's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident .
the nosek family 's representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of czk CD CD CD approx .
us CD CD .
altogether , CD witnesses delivered their testimonies on february CD , CD .
among them were friends of daniel nosek .
nosek and CD friends had come to attend the concert from vrchlabí , a town in mountains some CD kilometres CD CD northwest of prague .
they described nosek as a huge fan of lamb of god who had been able to secure an autograph from a guitar player before the concert had started .
nosek 's friend jan jebavý testified that nosek climbed the stage , and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by blythe off the stage .
he said he was CD sure blythe pushed nosek with both hands .
he further said that blythe 's behavior deviated from all the concerts he had attended in the past , commenting that blythe was visibly furious .
he further claimed that nosek was not the first person to be chased off the stage by blythe , with another fan being kicked , choked and receiving a punch from blythe .
jebavý corroborated blythe 's testimony that blythe asked are you okay
after nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply .
however , as nosek fell sick after the concert , they called him an ambulance .
according to jebavý , the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it .
nosek 's other friend ondřej vlach testified that nosek 's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore .
nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage .
according to him , blythe ran into the CD fans and pushed them both off .
while the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage , nosek fell directly on the ground .
according to vlach , there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break .
vlach further testified that after the fall , nosek went to sit on a bench , where he was fetched a water bottle .
nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back of his head , they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion .
vlach said that he understood blythe 's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage .
another person to testify was robert havelka , who worked as a security guard the night of the incident .
havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage , but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage .
he testified that he pulled CD person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured .
he further said that the fan 's fall might have been helped by someone else , perhaps the singer , though he did not see it precisely .
blythe 's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in CD and at the court .
among other things , CD of the witnesses originally alleged that nosek and blythe shook hands or that CD of them offered hand to another on stage .
however , at the court hearing , he testified that there was no prior contact between them .
blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior .
milan pořádek , the fan whom blythe admitted to shoving off the stage , testified on the third day of the trial .
pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive .
he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage .
pořádek testified that blythe knocked him down , knelt on him and held him down for a moment , but blythe definitely did not choke him .
he also admitted that taking into account the fact that he pořádek was drunk and the way he acted , blythe 's reaction was adequate .
he commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage .
another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that blythe 's behavior was standard to metal concerts , saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception .
she said that it was evident that blythe did not want any fans on the stage .
neither the CD nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of nosek 's fall at the end of the concert .
the judge also read a sworn statement from abaton 's former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident .
she was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation .
the court further heard that lamb of god had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed CD CD metres CD CD ft from the stage .
promoter tomáš fiala testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert .
randy blythe was called again to the stand that day .
the judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions .
the judge went again through the blythe 's testimony and , with a view to the previous witness statements , asked blythe whether he insists that it was milan pořádek whom blythe threw off the stage .
blythe responded by saying to the best of my knowledge , it was milan pořádek who was coming up on stage every time .
also that day , expert medical witness michal pogoši took the stand .
according to the prague post , pogoši testified that nosek 's because of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the brainstem .
pogoši added that the mortality rate from this kind of injury is around CD percent , and that doctors could not have done more to save the patient .
nosek was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue , where the initial diagnosis took place .
since this hospital did not have a specialized neurology department , nosek was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis .
there , nosek underwent CD operations , first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone .
finally , defense asked for adjournment as a key witness fell ill .
the court decided to continue with the hearings the next day , after which the hearings would be adjourned until march CD , CD , in order to hear the defense 's witness .
blythe committed to return when the trial resumed .
on february CD , CD , only CD witness took the stand before the hearing was adjourned .
lukáš havlena contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he did not like the description of the situation by the previous witnesses .
he said he did not think blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show .
he also said that each time somebody got on the stage , blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there .
havlena testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage CD times and that as he was preparing to stage dive , somebody aided his fall from behind .
he had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground .
havlena had trouble recalling details from the show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in abaton , and thus could not describe , among other things , the position of the guardrail .
the trial resumed on march CD , CD with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology tereza soukupová , appointed by the court and psychiatry alena gayová , appointed by the defense .
blythe returned to attend the hearings in person , even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence .
the CD expert witnesses agreed that blythe is not aggressive .
nevertheless , he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress .
the court further heard testimonies from CD eyewitnesses .
CD of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall .
he testified that when by the exit , he saw CD men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air .
he said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage .
the ambulance arrived CD CD minutes later .
another eyewitness was a fan , alena rozsívalová , who testified that she saw blythe shove nosek , saying h e climbed onto the stage , and when he tried to stand up , blythe shoved him .
according to her , the shove was strong enough for nosek to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment .
she testified that nosek fell backwards .
another attendee of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert .
a defense appointed expert witness in the field of biomechanics testified on march CD that nosek could not turn CD degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward , he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head .
he further said that if nosek fell over the first row of the fans , he must have been not only pushed , but must have jumped himself .
the state attorney immediately attacked this testimony , claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time , as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies , according to which nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall .
the presiding judge agreed with the state attorney on some of his points .
in his closing speech , the state attorney asked the court to incarcerate blythe for CD years , claiming that even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury .
a nosek family representative said that based on the witness testimonies , the family did not believe that blythe was solely responsible .
he continued that he would not be substantiating the requested amount , as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered .
he further added that daniel had died on his father 's birthday , and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work .
in his closing word , blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so .
he further commented that in case of acquittal , measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at lamb of god concerts again .
on march CD , CD , the court delivered a verdict , according to which blythe was not criminally liable for nosek 's death , even though he had the moral responsibility for it .
consequently , the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of blythe 's bail .
the court held that it was proven that blythe had thrown nosek off the stage .
however , blythe , due to his nearsightedness , could have mistaken nosek for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the guardrail .
according to the court , the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members .
judge kubovec further reproached blythe for not having met with the nosek family .
the state attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict .
the state attorney 's appeal was heard by a panel of CD judges of the prague high court , chaired by judge jiří lněnička .
the hearing took place in blythe 's absence .
blythe 's acquittal was upheld by the panel on june CD , CD .
the verdict may have been appealed by the supreme state attorney ssa to the supreme court .
as the appeal has not been lodged by ssa within CD months of the delivery of written second instance verdict , it has become final .
in CD blythe demanded ca czk CD millions for damages but the municipal court for prague CD dismissed the suit .
in reaction to the arrest and detention , a fan created a petition at the official white house petition site .
by the time blythe was released on bail , it gathered over CD CD signatures .
on july CD , CD , there was a vigil organized in lamb of god 's hometown of richmond , virginia , by a friend of blythe 's .
at the event , gwar who are also from richmond frontman dave brockie said i don t think it was right for him to be arrested .
i don t think it was right for him to be locked up this stuff could have all been worked out diplomatically or legally before he got there .
in addition to brockie , other notable figures in heavy metal , such as tom araya and david draiman , have also come out in support of blythe .
in a post to his blog , blythe explained that he met the nosek family in private after the trial , and promised them to be a spokesperson for safer shows .
he emphasized that the family never attacked him and just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son .

us CD comes to a CD way intersection and turns northeast merging onto us CD .
the concurrent highway runs from powers through the communities of wilson and spaulding on the south side of the cn railway .
at harris , the trunkline enters the hannahville indian community .
harris is on the menominee county side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to bark river on the delta county side .
the county line in between not only separates the CD communities , but also serves as the boundary between the central and eastern time zones .
east of bark river , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of m CD .
the roadway crosses the ford river prior to turning due east into the outskirts of escanaba .
us CD us CD widens to CD lanes along ludington street , which forms the east west axis of the escanaba street grid .
near downtown , the highway meets m CD , which runs along the city 's north south axis , lincoln avenue .
the trunklines merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor .
lincoln avenue runs north carrying CD lanes of traffic past the upper peninsula state fairgrounds , site of CD of the CD state fairs for the state of michigan , the only state to have twin fairs .
us CD us CD m CD continues north on lincoln avenue past the campus of bay de noc community college .
the CD lane highway crosses the escanaba river just upstream from its mouth near the large mead paper mill and shifts to run immediately next to little bay de noc .
the section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of us CD in the state an average of CD CD vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in CD .
the road turns inland again , and us CD us CD m CD passes to the west of downtown gladstone .
the highway through here is an expressway , CD lanes divided by a central median and no driveway access .
unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges .
the highway intersects the eastern terminus of county road CD cr CD and crosses the els railroad south of the stoplight for 4th avenue north , where m CD separates from the us highways and turns to the northwest .
the expressway continues north parallel to the cn railway , crossing the days river .
through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of CD mph CD km h for car traffic .
this is the only road in the up with a speed limit higher than CD mph CD km h besides i CD , which has a speed limit of CD mph CD km h .
the expressway segment runs around the upper end of little bay de noc before ending at rapid river .
in this location , us CD separates to the north , and us CD returns to an easterly track as a CD lane road , crossing the rapid and whitefish rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay .
as us CD crosses southern delta county , it passes through the western unit of the hiawatha national forest .
near garden corners , the highway runs along the shore of big bay de noc .
after the intersection with the northern terminus of m CD , us CD turns inland cutting across the base of the garden peninsula and enters schoolcraft county .
as the highway approaches thompson , us CD leaves the western unit of the hiawatha national forest and enters the lake superior state forest .
the roadway runs along lake michigan to manistique , crossing the manistique river .
the trunkline turns inland approaching gulliver and then turns north northeast to blaney park .
the community there is a former logging town turned resort at the southern terminus of m CD .
the resort was active from the late CD but declined by the 1980s .
from blaney park , us CD turns due east and crosses into mackinac county west of gould city .
where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the cn railway CD last time and runs to the south of engadine to follow the lake michigan shoreline through naubinway .
after passing the community of epoufette , us CD crosses the cut river bridge , CD feet CD m over the cut river .
the highway crosses into the eastern unit of the hiawatha national forest near brevort , running between lake michigan and brevort lake in the process .
the road continues along the lake michigan shoreline , passing mystery spot near gros cap and turning inland immediately west of st. ignace .
the us CD designation ends at the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with i CD .
the roadway continues easterly into downtown st. ignace as business loop i CD bl i CD .
in CD , the first transportation routes through what became the state of michigan were the lakes , rivers and indian trails .
CD of these trails followed parts of the future us CD .
the sault green bay trail roughly followed the lake michigan shoreline routing of us CD between escanaba and st. ignace .
the mackinac trail connected st. ignace with sault ste .
marie .
in the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed us CD through the up were given a few different highway names .
when the original roadways between ironwood and iron river were completed in late CD , the upper peninsula development bureau updb named the area cloverland and the highway the cloverland trail .
later the name was extended over the highway to escanaba , and to all highways in the area in the early CD .
the name was phased out by the updb completely in CD .
the roadways were also used for the theodore roosevelt international highway , named for former us president theodore roosevelt after his death in CD .
overall , this highway ran from portland , oregon , to portland , maine , by way of michigan and the canadian province of ontario .
through the up , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to us CD , including the section through florence county , wisconsin .
the great lakes automobile route was established in CD by the updb .
branches of the route followed us CD and m CD between powers and escanaba .
the route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around lake michigan .
the name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of world war i.
CD canadian auto trail was routed through the up as well .
in CD , the king 's international highway linked vancouver , british columbia , to halifax , nova scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of lake superior .
motorists had to ship their cars by boat between sault ste .
marie , ontario , and thunder bay or enter the united states to continue along the auto trail .
the routings varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used us CD through the up from ironwood to sault ste .
marie until a highway north of lake superior was opened in CD .
by that time , the auto trail had taken on the trans canada highway name .
the first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern us CD was m CD , a designation that was in use by july CD , CD , between ironwood and sault ste .
marie .
the first roadside park in the country was created by herbert larson near what is now us CD near iron river in CD CD , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside us CD grand river avenue in CD south of saranac .
when the us highway system was created on november CD , CD , us CD partially replaced m CD .
between crystal falls and iron mountain , us CD was routed through florence , wisconsin .
the former routing of m CD from crystal falls to sagola became a new m CD when the former m CD became us CD now us CD .
m CD from sagola south to iron mountain was made a part of an extended m CD , which is now m CD .
by the next year , m CD was added along us CD from rexton to garnet as part of a larger extension .
the first changes to the routing of us CD itself were made in CD with a bypass of downtown escanaba .
a larger rerouting was completed in CD between rogers park and sault ste .
marie .
the new routing followed mackinac trail instead of turning east to cedarville and north to sault ste .
marie .
the former routing was given the m CD designation .
another realignment in the iron mountain area shifted us CD us CD to a new bridge over the menominee river between CD and CD .
downtown ironwood was bypassed in CD , and the former route was initially designated m CD .
the michigan state highway department mshd changed the routings and designations of the highways around cooks , thompson and manistique in the mid 1930s .
the agency rerouted us CD between cooks and m CD in thompson , turning the old road back to county control .
the section between m CD and m CD was redesignated as an extension of m CD to thompson , and m CD was replaced by a further extension of m CD .
the last change was to route us CD along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on august CD , CD .
the mshd started construction in CD on a new road that rerouted us CD into st. ignace for the first time .
between brevort and moran , us CD previously followed worth road inland to the tahquamenon trail to meet the northern extension of us CD into the upper peninsula .
the new routing took us CD along the lakeshore into st. ignace .
us CD was truncated to the state ferry docks in mackinaw city and us CD was routed through st. ignace along the former us CD to rogers park .
the connection in st. ignace to the state ferry docks became m CD .
further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near watersmeet and crystal falls .
additional realignments were completed by the mshd to move us CD to its modern lakeshore routing between gould city and epoufette in CD .
the new highway traveled due east from gould city to naubinway and then along the lake to epoufette .
the former route through engadine was turned back to local control as far east as garnet .
from there east , it was numbered just m CD , removing us CD from a concurrency .
another former section into epoufette was added to extend m CD .
the new highway was detoured around the cut river bridge until it was completed in CD after construction delays over steel shortages during world war ii .
the western end of us CD took on CD changes in the 1940s .
m CD was extended along us CD to the state line at ironwood from its western terminus at wakefield .
a similar extension was made from m 28 's eastern terminus to sault ste .
marie in CD .
the m CD designation was renumbered as business us CD by CD .
the eastern m CD extension was reversed in CD , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by CD .
with the coming of the interstate highway system in michigan , the mshd planned to convert the eastern section of us CD to a freeway between st. ignace and sault st. marie .
in planning maps from CD , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the interstates .
it was also included in the general location of national system of interstate highways including all additional routes at urban areas designated in september CD , or yellow book after the cover color , that was released in CD as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system .
the proposed number in CD was interstate CD i CD .
the first section of freeway was built in late CD or early CD between evergreen shores and m CD north of st. ignace .
the mackinac bridge was opened to traffic on november CD , CD .
a new section of freeway and an interchange connected us CD to the bridge .
in CD , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the mackinac bridge and evergreen shores sections .
at the time , the i CD designation supplanted us CD on the bridge , and us CD was shifted to follow i CD along the freeways in the st. ignace area .
the former routing of us CD in downtown st. ignace was redesignated bl i CD .
more sections of freeway were opened in CD immediately to the south of the newly constructed international bridge in sault ste .
marie as well as between dafter and kinross .
the last CD sections opened in CD connected the northern end of the freeway at m CD to kinross , and the section between dafter and sault ste .
marie .
at this time , all of us CD 's former routing became a county road known as mackinac trail h CD .
the department of state highways expanded us CD us CD into an expressway between gladstone and rapid river in CD .
the state built a new bridge over the manistique river in CD , bypassing downtown .
mdot disposed of the former routing of us CD into downtown in CD ways .
the western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control .
an extension of m CD replaced the remainder , including the siphon bridge , through downtown .
in that same year , the department truncated us CD to end in st. ignace by removing it from the i CD freeway .
the last changes were made to us 2 's routing through iron river in CD , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town .
in CD , mdot raised the speed limit along the expressway section in delta county from CD to CD mph CD to CD km h , although the speed limit for trucks remains CD mph CD km h .
on july CD , CD , the state administrative board named m CD , the predecessor to us CD in michigan , the bohn highway to honor frank p. bohn , a prominent local citizen who later served in congress from CD to CD .
in CD , the residents of escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of world war i called memory lane .
the project consisted of elm and maple trees planted along us CD us CD west of town .
the american legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers .
later in CD , the bessemer women 's club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans .
also called memory lane , the group planted CD elms and CD CD evergreens , trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along CD CD miles CD CD km of us CD east of bessemer .
most of us CD , along with us CD in the lower peninsula , was designated the united spanish war veterans memorial highway in CD .
to connect the gap in the routing where us CD cuts through wisconsin , m CD and m CD were used in place of us CD between iron mountain and crystal falls .
signs marking the highway were not erected until CD when governor george w. romney had them installed .
the amvets memorial drive designation was created for the section of us CD us CD m CD between the northern escanaba city limits and county road CD cr CD in delta county .
the american veterans amvets organization in michigan petitioned the michigan legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under public act CD in CD .
these CD tours were created in may CD through a joint effort between mdot and its counterparts in wisconsin , minnesota and ontario .
the section of us CD between iron river and crystal falls has been named the iron county heritage trail .
this pure michigan byway was designated to honor the rich history of CD industries that built a state and nation mining and logging .
on august CD , CD , mdot announced that the section of us CD that runs concurrently with m CD in delta county was being included in the up hidden coast recreational heritage trail .
there are CD bridges along current or former sections of us CD that mdot has added to its listing of michigan 's historic bridges .
CD of these are also listed on the national register of historic places nrhp .
a third bridge added to the nrhp in late CD has not been added to mdot 's listing however .
the first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the iron river , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge .
the original structure , dating to CD , is a CD foot long CD m spandrel arch span that was built by the mshd as trunk line bridge no. CD .
the structure was listed on the nrhp on december CD , CD , for its architectural and engineering significance .
in december CD , the national park service approved the listing of the upper twin falls bridge that crosses the menominee river northwest of iron mountain .
the structure is a single span , pin connected , camelback , through truss bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in michigan .
it was built between CD and CD because the twin falls power dam would flood an existing river crossing .
the span cost CD CD equivalent to CD CD in CD , paid equally by dickinson and florence counties .
until the 1930s , the upper twin falls bridge carried us CD across the menominee river .
in CD , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span .
the bridge closed to automobile traffic in september CD , and the nomination process for inclusion on the national register of historic places began in CD .
in CD , mdot replaced the sturgeon river bridge in waucedah township , dickinson county .
as of october CD , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , mdot retained it on their historic bridge list .
it was built in CD .
before CD , us CD used a different routing through manistique and crossed the manistique river on what is nicknamed the siphon bridge .
built as a part of a raceway flume on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface .
this produces a siphon effect , giving the bridge its nickname .
the manistique pulp and paper company was organized in CD and needed a dam on the manistique river to supply their mill .
this dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction .
instead of expensive dikes , a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed .
the sides of this tank provided man made banks higher than the natural banks .
the michigan works progress administration described the bridge as having concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , that allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed .
the manistique tourism council stated at CD time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was atmospherically forced under it , and that the bridge has been featured in ripley 's believe it or not
.
the CD span structure is CD feet CD m long .
the cut river bridge carries us CD across the cut river in hendricks township , mackinac county .
this structure was built during world war ii but completion was delayed due to war induced steel shortages .
the span uses CD short tons CD long tons .
CD t of structural steel to bridge the CD feet CD m over the river and its gorge at a height of CD feet CD m above the river .
the cut river bridge is CD of only CD cantilevered deck truss bridges in the state .
on either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river .
listed on the nrhp on december CD , CD , the mackinac trail carp river bridge carries h CD , the modern successor to us CD , over the carp river north of st. ignace .
the bridge is another spandrel arch structure CD feet CD m in length and built in CD .
increasing traffic along mackinac trail prompted the mshd to widen its deck by CD feet CD CD m and install new guardrails in the CD CD biennium along with the addition of decorative retaining walls .
the last of the historic bridges along a former segment of us CD is the structure carrying ashmun street bs i CD over the power canal in sault ste .
marie .
built in CD , it is CD of only CD steel arch bridges in the state .
the CD foot wide CD m and CD foot long CD m structure is described by mdot as massive with an innovative construction method the previous structure was used as a falsework for the current bridge before removal .
mdot has erected milemarkers along the CD michigan segments of the highway that use the total mileage starting at the state line in ironwood .
the signs on the eastern segment reflect the mileage in florence county , wisconsin .
business you.s. highway CD bus .
us CD is a CD CD mile CD CD km business route that runs from the wisconsin state line at the montreal river .
the route extends through downtown ironwood on silver and aurora streets before turning northward along suffolk street .

us CD bears north through a residential area along douglas street .
the eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with us CD at the corner of cloverland drive and douglas street north of downtown .
the business route was created in august CD when former m CD in ironwood was renumbered as a business loop of us CD .

in CD , a group of enthusiasts purchased thelnetham windmill for restoration .
numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an CD year period .
the mill is open to the public , and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site .
the mill is a small CD storey tower mill with patent sails and winded by a fantail .
it drives CD pairs of millstones , with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine .

the derelict mill and an acre of land cost CD CD .
the mill was restored over a period of CD years .
much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill .
the consortium took possession of the mill in november CD .
the first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible .
polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure .
the mill was surveyed and recorded .
in spring CD , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure .
scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame .
a CD week work in was held at the end of july and beginning of august CD .
CD CD volunteers worked on the mill over the work in .
CD new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at bury st edmunds .
on CD august CD , the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast iron curb sections .
new oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower .
the bin floor was removed , apart from CD oak main beam which was repairable .
a replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired .
new oak joists were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused .
CD of these had previously been a whip from a common sail .
some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the eastbridge windpump , which , following its collapse on CD february CD , had been re erected at the museum of east anglian life , stowmarket .
the sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new lintels were made for some of the windows .
a tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter .
the floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and CD of the CD pairs of millstones was removed .
the work was financed by grants of CD from the council for the preservation of rural essex , CD from st edmundsbury borough council , CD from the scarfe trust , and CD from the suffolk mills group .
other donations and income amounted to CD , with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the CD owners .
the work in was reported in both local and national media , including bbc look east , bury free press , eastern daily press , east anglian daily times , daily telegraph , and radio orwell .
in the CD season CD separate work ins were held , the first from CD july to CD august and the second from CD august to CD august .
a total of CD volunteers participated over the CD weeks .
the millstones were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired .
CD of the main beams was found to have been attacked by death watch beetles , and over a third of the elm beam was replaced with oak .
the CD supports for the hurst frame were repaired CD at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above .
CD post required replacement .
it had rotted and the floor had sunk by CD inches CD mm causing the second main floor beam to fracture .
when this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in CD piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed .
the new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was concreted .
the stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse .
other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine .
new floorboards were laid in the dust floor , the CD CD CD inches CD mm thick elm boards being double grooved with a metal tongue between them .
those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration .
the top CD courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a trammel attached to the upright shaft .
during the second work in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double grooved boards with a metal tongue between them .
the window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top CD courses of brickwork continued .
the top CD courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks .
the dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted .
the windshaft , the curb segments and fantail gearing were given CD coats of red lead paint .
a new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak CD feet CD mm long by CD inches CD mm diameter .
a start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar .
after the work in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn .
the work done in CD cost CD CD .
donations received were CD CD from rank xerox , CD CD from the historic buildings council and CD from st edmundsbury borough council .
other donations and income received amounted to CD .
the project received further coverage in local media , the eastern daily press , and south norfolk news .
the CD work ins took place from CD july to CD august and CD august to CD august .
the work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the elm curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows .
the cap frame was constructed , incorporating CD beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused .
the cap frame was completed in autumn CD .
it had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position .
work in the early part of CD was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the various parts of the fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling the patent sails .
the mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits , including CD from the wind and watermill section of the society for the protection of ancient buildings .
other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the CD feet CD inches CD CD m stones , including dismantling the stone nut and replacement of CD cogs in beech .
when the weather improved , work commenced outside .
the cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work in commenced .
the work ins took place over CD separate weeks in july and august , with CD people participating .
during the first work in , the fantail posts and braces were fitted .
the oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting .
intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass .
the cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings .
the rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time .
between the CD work ins , the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed .
this enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the monday of the second work in .
the boards for the cap are inch CD mm thick and CD inches CD mm wide at the petticoat , tapering towards the top .
a new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft , not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit .
when the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints .
the petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass , and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position , producing a sturdy structure .
the striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts .
at the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position .
repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work in .
after the work ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift on in october .
the weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern microporous paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof , was completed in time for the lift on .
a mini work in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with CD people participating over the weekend .
final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill .
the tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled .
the CD ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on CD october CD , watched by a crowd of some CD people .
the fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from adnams brewery , southwold .
restoration work in CD cost CD CD .
grants were received from the association of independent museums , blo norton women 's institute , ipswich historical transport society , the national association for gifted children , mr d. porter and the society for the protection of ancient buildings .
further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by wilf foreman .
CD work ins were held during CD .
the first CD were by apprentices from eastern electricity board .
thelnetham windmill was chosen at the project to benefit from the young person 's development project for that year .
pakenham watermill had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the suffolk preservation trust , had suggested that thelnetham windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme .
CD separate parties spent a week each at the mill .
a mains electricity supply was provided .
an underground cable was laid with assistance from british telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at martlesham heath .
the thrust borer laid CD yards CD m of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position .
the mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor .
other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position .
a concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising damp .
a french drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem .
a CD horsepower CD kw ruston hornsby 4yhr diesel engine had been purchased in CD and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane .
after fitting it was then painted .
some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary .
off site , the new brake wheel and fantail were made .
the original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in CD .
the original brake wheel was CD feet CD CD m diameter to allow the common sails to run at their optimum speed .
when the mill was modernised in CD it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as patent sails run at a slower speed than common sails .
the great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter .
the brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs , resulting in a wheel CD feet CD inches CD CD m in diameter .
the opinion of professional millwrights was sought , and it was decided that a scaled up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments .
the remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill .
the original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat treated malleable cast iron .
when the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly .
the fantail was made .
some of the small gears were replaced .
the stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from douglas fir .
work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only CD window still needing attention when the first work in began .
new beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft .
the stocks and sails were made during the CD work ins held in july and august , a total of CD people attending over the CD weeks .
a second hand stock had been bought in the CD and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use .
thus CD new stocks were required instead of CD .
modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds , leaving CD options .
traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or laminated stocks .
good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required .
douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds .
a douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only CD years .
thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made .
the CD feet CD CD m long stocks were made from douglas fir .
all timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned .
it was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to CD stronger than a similar stock of solid timber .
the timber used was CD CD CD inches CD mm thick and CD laminations were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft .
careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber .
both stocks were made during the work in , with CD of them being trimmed and finished ready for use .
the stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs .
the CD sails were made .
the originals being slightly different pairs .
those on the inner stock having bays of CD feet CD mm pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of CD feet CD inches CD mm pitch .
it was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch .
CD CD feet CD CD m long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at bury st edmunds .
the whips are CD inches CD mm square at their inner end .
sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality .
the mortices for the sail bars were cut .
that at the heel of the sail being at CD and that at the tip being CD , decreasing by CD at each sail bar .
CD of the CD sails had been completed at the end of the work in .
the fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill .
at the end of the second work in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank .
the fantail itself , with the blades painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards .
the clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft .
it was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by inch CD mm .
when this was corrected the brake wheel was within CD CD th of an inch less than CD mm of true .
the clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year .
other work included a new frame for CD of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork .
the CD sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work in .
the stock , with CD sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock .
the process was repeated for the second pair of sails .
the mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work in .
work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing .
the brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast .
restoration work in CD cost CD CD .
grants received were CD CD from english heritage , CD from st edmundsbury borough council , other donations amounted to CD .
income from open days at the mill came to CD .
a boost to the funds was CD CD from hervey benham .
this money had been allocated to allow the moving of a derelict post mill buck to thelnetham .
in the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and mr benham allowed the donation to remain with the thelnetham mill preservation trust .
the project received further support in local media , including the east anglian daily times , CD of the work ins being featured on anglia television 's about anglia programme .
work planned for CD included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails .
the external walls of the mill were tarred and internal walls plastered .
CD work ins were held , from CD july to CD july and CD august to CD august .
further work over the next CD years saw the restoration completed in CD .
the restoration of thelnetham windmill was made possible by the efforts of CD individuals and CD organisations .
this was achieved by the donation of labour , plant , materials or grants of money , or by giving discounts for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project .

sailor mouth is the first segment of the 18th episode of the second season , or the 38th overall episode of the american animated television series spongebob squarepants .
the episode was directed by andrew overtoom , and was written by walt dohrn , paul tibbitt , and merriwether williams .
dohrn and tibbitt also served as storyboard directors , and carson kugler , william reiss , and erik wiese worked as storyboard artists .
it originally aired on nickelodeon in the united states on september CD , CD .
the series follows the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of bikini bottom .

however , when mr. krabs accidentally injures his toe , he utters all the CD bad words .
the CD cannot believe it and run to mama krabs to tell on him .
mama krabs , who is appalled by their use of the words , makes the CD paint her house as punishment .
the episode received positive reviews , while various members of the spongebob squarepants crew consider the episode to be CD of their favorites , mainly due to the satirical nature of the episode .
however , the episode was not immune to negative reception , and was criticized by watchdog media group the parents television council and fans , who interpreted the episode as an example of promoting and implicitly satirizing use of profanity towards children .
when spongebob goes around to the back of the krusty krab to take out the trash , he reads some words written on a dumpster .
spongebob asks patrick what is it and patrick says that the word is a sentence enhancer which is used when you want to talk fancy .
the next day , spongebob walks into the krusty krab and says the word to patrick and then over the intercom .
the krusty krab customers are appalled by spongebob 's use of his word and leave .
squidward then informs mr. krabs , who then decides to tell them that they were using profanity , and mentions that there are CD swear words they should not use .
spongebob and patrick vow mr. krabs that they will never use swear words again .
later , they play their favorite game , eels and escalators .
patrick always gets escalators but spongebob always gets eels .
eventually , he loses the game and accidentally utters the swear word .
patrick then races to the krusty krab to tell mr. krabs with spongebob trying to stop him .
spongebob bursts through the front door and tells mr. krabs that patrick said the swear word , patrick then joins along .
eventually , mr. krabs stops their gibberish explanations , and takes spongebob and patrick outside and makes them paint the krusty krab as punishment .
mr. krabs is about to give spongebob and patrick the job , but he hits his foot on a rock , throws the paint away and says all CD swear words while complaining about his foot being injured .
when spongebob and patrick hear all the swear words , they run to mama krabs house to tell her that mr. krabs swears .
when they all reach her house , they repeat the same swear words that mr. krabs used .
this makes her faint , but shortly after mr. krabs scolds spongebob and patrick for saying all those bad words in front of her she regains consciousness .
mama krabs states that all CD of them should be ashamed for saying all those words .
she then gives all CD of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment for saying those words at her .
sailor mouth was directed by andrew overtoom , and was written by walt dohrn , paul tibbitt , and merriwether williams .
dohrn and tibbitt also served as storyboard directors , and carson kugler , william reiss and erik wiese worked as storyboard artists .
series creator stephen hillenburg has described the episode plot as a classic thing all kids go through .
much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers own experiences from childhood .
the episode originally aired on nickelodeon in the united states on september CD , CD .
the episode marks the introduction of mr. krabs mother , mama krabs , who was voiced by former spongebob squarepants creative producer and current executive producer paul tibbitt .
the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode .
the idea for sailor mouth was inspired by creative director derek drymon 's experience when i got in trouble for saying the f word in front of my mother .
drymon said , the scene where patrick is running to mr. krabs to tattle , with spongebob chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life .
the end of the episode , where mr. krabs uses more profanity than spongebob and patrick , was also inspired by the fact that my drymon 's mother has a sailor mouth herself .
the scene where spongebob and patrick playing a game of eels and escalators , which is a parody of snakes and ladders , was difficult for the crew to animate , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location .
according to the series season CD dvd commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had spongebob saying go dolphin noise yourself followed by patrick saying dolphin noise you too
during the eels and escalators game .
it was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience .
sailor mouth was released on the dvd compilation called spongebob squarepants sea stories on march CD , CD .
it was also included in the spongebob squarepants the complete 2nd season dvd released on october CD , CD .
on september CD , CD , sailor mouth was released on the spongebob squarepants the first CD episodes , alongside all the episodes of seasons CD through CD .
erik wiese , a member of the spongebob squarepants crew , considers sailor mouth to be his favorite episode , mainly due to its random and satirical nature , saying sometimes spongebob just catches me off guard .
nancy basile of about.com ranked the episode at number CD for her list of the top CD spongebob squarepants episodes .
she said sailor mouth just barely missed being in the number CD slot .
basile praised the episode 's plot and called it genius because children can relate to the forbidden thrill of using curse words , and adults can laugh at the parody of tv censorship .
in an interview with paul tibbitt , CD of the episode 's writers , he told that sailor mouth is his second favorite spongebob episode .
in a later report , several members of the ptc listed sailor mouth as an example of how levels of profane , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children 's television programming .
nickelodeon , in response to the incident , said it is sad and a little desperate that they stooped to literally putting profane language in the mouths of our characters to make a point .
has the fcc looked at this
richard huff of the new york daily news criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of spongebob squarepants , sailor mouth , over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly .
the military history of australia spans the nation 's CD year modern history , from the early australian frontier wars between aboriginals and europeans to the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in the early 21st century .
although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on australian society and national identity , including the anzac spirit .
the relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma .
in total , nearly CD CD australians died during the course of these conflicts .
war and military service have been defining influences in australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the australian experience of war and of soldiering , known as the anzac spirit .
these ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , larrikinism , egalitarianism and mateship .
traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of australian soldiers fighting at gallipoli during the first world war .
the gallipoli campaign was CD of the first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity .
the relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by CD of the more enduring themes of australian strategic culture bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare .
indeed , australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until the japanese crisis of CD , while since then an alliance with the united states has underwritten its security .
arguably , this pattern of bandwagoning both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more pragmatic security concerns has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies .
regardless , a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident , with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises .
a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges .
reflecting both the realist and liberal paradigms of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in australian strategic culture are also obvious .
likewise , multilateralism , collective security and defence self reliance have also been important themes .
change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history , being the product of australian society 's democratic political tradition and judaeo christian anglo european heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology .
these behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely european island on the edge of the asia pacific , and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power .
to be sure , during threats to the core australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars .
throughout these conflicts australian soldiers known colloquially as diggers have often been noted , somewhat paradoxically , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities .
from CD until CD the defence of the australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces .
originally marines protected the early settlements at sydney cove and norfolk island , however they were relieved of these duties in CD by a british army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the new south wales corps .
the new south wales corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of irish convicts at castle hill in CD .
soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the war office of the need for a more reliable garrison in new south wales and van diemen 's land .
chief of these shortcomings was the rum rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in CD .
as a result , in january CD the 73rd perthshire regiment of foot arrived in australia .
by CD , CD british infantry regiments had served in australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units .
although the primary role of the british army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever materialised .
the british army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating bushranging , putting down convict rebellions as occurred at bathurst in CD and to suppress aboriginal resistance to the extension of european settlement .
notably british soldiers were involved in the battle at the eureka stockade in CD on the victorian goldfields .
members of british regiments stationed in australia also saw action in india , afghanistan , new zealand and the sudan .
during the early years of settlement the naval defence of australia was provided by detached royal navy units of the east indies station , based in sydney .
however , in CD australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore , marking the first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed in australia .
the royal navy remained the primary naval force in australian waters until CD , when the australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to the royal australian navy .
the royal navy 's depots , dockyards and structures were given to the australian people .
the reactions of the native aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of british settlers in australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants lands .
european diseases decimated aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation .
by and large neither the british nor the aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare .
at times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of british soldiers and later mounted police units .
not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes .
fighting between aborigines and europeans was localised as the aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance .
as a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent .
organised or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century .
this warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic myth of peaceful settlement in australia .
faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres .
among the most famous is the battle of pinjarra in western australia in CD .
such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the myall creek massacre in new south wales in CD CD europeans were hanged for their part in the killings .
however , in tasmania the so called black war was fought between CD and CD , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas .
although it began in failure for the british , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population .
it may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as CD sided and mainly perpetrated by europeans on aborigines .
although many more aborigines died than british , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the europeans .
aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre existing hunting and fighting practices using spears , clubs and other primitive weapons .
unlike the indigenous peoples of new zealand and north america , on the main aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the europeans .
although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread .
the aborigines were never a serious military threat to european settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them .
on occasions large groups of aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage .
this could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded .
however , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the aborigines than the europeans .
central to the success of the europeans was the use of firearms .
however , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated .
prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often cumbersome muzzle loading , smooth bore , single shot muskets with flint lock mechanisms .
such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within CD metres CD ft .
these deficiencies may have initially given the aborigines an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs .
yet by CD significant advances in firearms gave the europeans a distinct advantage , with the CD shot colt revolver , the snider single shot breech loading rifle and later the martini henry rifle , as well as rapid fire rifles such as the winchester rifle , becoming available .
these weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of aborigines , often proved successful .
the europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast moving , often hidden enemies .
tactics employed included night time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks .
the conflict lasted for over CD years and followed the pattern of british settlement in australia .
beginning in new south wales with the arrival of the first europeans in may CD , it continued in sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s .
as the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback new south wales in the CD .
in tasmania , fighting can be traced from CD to the 1830s , while in victoria and the southern parts of south australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and CD .
the south west of western australia experienced warfare from CD to CD .
the war in queensland began in the area around brisbane in the CD and continued until CD , moving to central queensland in the 1850s and CD , and then to northern queensland from the CD to CD .
in western australia , the violence moved north with european settlement , reaching the kimberley region by CD , with violent clashes continuing until the CD .
in the northern territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s .
CD estimate of casualties places european deaths at CD CD , while at least CD CD aborigines are believed to have perished .
far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century .
a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist .
in CD , the victorian ship hmcss victoria was dispatched to help the new zealand colonial government in its war against māori in taranaki .
victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support , although a number of personnel were involved in actions against māori fortifications .
CD sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment .
in late CD , the new zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the waikato province against the māori .
promised settlement on confiscated land , more than CD CD australians over half of whom were from victoria were recruited to form CD waikato regiments .
other australians became scouts in the company of forest rangers .
despite experiencing arduous conditions the australians were not heavily involved in battle , and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties .
australians were involved in actions at matarikoriko , pukekohe east , titi hill , and te ranga .
fewer than CD were believed to have been killed in action .
the conflict was over by CD , and the waikato regiments disbanded in CD .
however , many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade , while many others had returned to australia .
from CD until CD , each of the CD colonial governments was responsible for their own defence .
the colonies had gained responsible government between CD and CD , and while the colonial office in london retained control of some affairs , the governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia .
to do this , they were granted the authority from the british crown to raise military and naval forces .
initially these were militias in support of british regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in CD , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities .
the colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component .
they were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline .
even after significant reforms in the CD including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense .
by CD , the forces numbered CD CD men .
although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the british empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising contingents to serve in sudan , south africa and china .
despite a reputation of colonial inferiority , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained .
during this period , defences in australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts .
however , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry .
as a consequence he called for a restructure of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies .
edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units obliged to serve anywhere in the south pacific to replace the volunteer forces .
these views found support in the influential new south wales commandant , major general edward hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria stifled the proposal .
these reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies .
with the exception of western australia , the colonies also operated their own navies .
in CD , victoria received its own naval vessel , hmcss victoria , and its deployment to new zealand in CD during the first taranaki war marked the first occasion that an australian warship had been deployed overseas .
the colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts .
victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad hmvs cerberus in service from CD , as well as the steam sail warship hms nelson on loan from the royal navy , CD small gunboats and CD torpedo boats .
new south wales formed a naval brigade in CD and by the start of the 20th century had CD small torpedo boats and a corvette .
the queensland maritime defence force was established in CD , while south australia operated a single ship , hmcs protector .
tasmania had also a small torpedo corps , while western australia 's only naval defences included the fremantle naval artillery .
naval personnel from new south wales and victoria took part in the suppression of the boxer rebellion in china in CD , while hmcs protector was sent by south australia but saw no action .
the separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until federation in CD , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new commonwealth of australia .
during the early years of the 1880s , an egyptian regime in the sudan , backed by the british , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native muhammad ahmad or ahmed , known as mahdi to his followers .
in CD , as part of the mahdist war , the egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces .
the british instructed the egyptians to abandon the sudan , and sent general charles gordon to co ordinate the evacuation , but he was killed in january CD .
when news of his death arrived in new south wales in february CD , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses .
the new south wales contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of CD men and CD officers , and an artillery battery of CD men and sailed from sydney on CD march CD .
the contingent arrived in suakin on CD march and were attached to a brigade that consisted of scots , grenadier and coldstream guards .
they subsequently marched for tamai in a large square formation made up of CD CD men .
reaching the village , they burned huts and returned to suakin CD australians were wounded in minor fighting .
most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards berber , on the nile .
the australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and CD men volunteered .
they rode on a reconnaissance to takdul on CD may and were heavily involved in a skirmish during which more than CD arabs were killed or captured .
on CD may , they made CD last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous march .
meanwhile , the artillery were posted at handoub and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at suakin .
eventually the british government decided that the campaign in sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in suakin .
the new south wales contingent sailed for home on CD may , arriving in sydney on CD june CD .
approximately CD australians served in sudan .
CD subsequently died of disease during the return journey while CD had been wounded during the campaign .
british encroachment into areas of south africa already settled by the afrikaner boers and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the second boer war in CD .
pre empting the deployment of british forces , the afrikaner republics of the orange free state and the transvaal republic under president paul kruger declared war on CD october CD , striking deep into the british territories of natal and the cape colony .
the first troops arrived CD weeks later , with the new south wales lancers who had been training in england before the war , hurriedly diverted to south africa .
on CD november , the lancers came under fire for the first time near belmont , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them .
following a series of minor victories , the british suffered a major setback during black week between CD CD december CD , although no australian units were involved .
the first contingents of infantry from victoria , south australia , western australia , and tasmania arrived in cape town on CD november and were designated the australian regiment under the command of colonel john charles hoad .
with a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry .
further units from queensland and new south wales arrived in december and were soon committed to the front .
the first casualties occurred soon after at sunnyside on CD january CD , after CD queensland mounted infantry and a column of canadians , british and artillery attacked a boer laager at belmont .
troopers david mcleod and victor jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the boer forward sentries .
regardless , the boers were surprised and during CD hours of heavy fighting , more than CD were killed and another CD taken prisoner .
CD CD queenslanders and the new south wales lancers subsequently took part in the siege of kimberley in february CD .
despite serious set backs at colenso , stormberg , magersfontein , and spion kop in january and with ladysmith still under siege the british mounted a CD division counter invasion of the orange free state in february .
the attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by lieutenant general john french with the new south wales lancers , queensland mounted infantry and new south wales army medical corps attached .
first , kimberley was relieved following the battles of modder river and magersfontein , and the retreating boers defeated at paardeberg , with the new south wales mounted rifles locating the boer general , piet cronjé .
the british entered bloemfontein on CD march CD , while ladysmith was relieved .
disease began to take its toll and scores of men died .
still the advance continued , with the drive to pretoria in may including more than CD CD australians .
johannesburg fell on CD may , and the boers withdrew from pretoria on CD june .
the new south wales mounted rifles and western australians saw action again at diamond hill on CD june .
mafeking was relieved on CD may .
following the defeat of the afrikaner republics still the boers held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt british troop movements and lines of supply .
this new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the australian colonies and the raising of the bushmen 's contingents , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse riding and shooting skills , but little military experience .
after federation in CD , CD australian commonwealth horse battalions of the newly created australian army were also sent to south africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended .
some australians later joined local south african irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge .
these soldiers were part of the british army , and were subject to british military discipline .
such units included the bushveldt carbineers which gained notoriety as the unit in which harry breaker morant and peter handcock served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes .
with the guerrillas requiring supplies , koos de la rey lead a force of CD CD boers against brakfontein , on the elands river in western transvaal .
the post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by CD australians and CD rhodesians .
the attack began on CD august CD with heavy shelling causing CD casualties .
during the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire .
a relief force was stopped by the boers , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved .
the siege lasted CD days , during which more than CD CD shells were fired into the post .
after calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the boers eventually retired .
the siege of elands river was CD of the major achievements of the australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on CD august .
in response the british adopted counter insurgency tactics , including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for boer women and children , and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit boer mobility and to protect railway communications .
such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the british , however they soon yielded results .
by mid CD , the bulk of the fighting was over , and british mounted units would ride at night to attack boer farmhouses or encampments , overwhelming them with superior numbers .
indicative of warfare in last months of CD , the new south wales mounted rifles travelled CD CD miles CD CD km and were involved in CD skirmishes , killing CD boers , wounding CD , and capturing CD for the loss of CD dead and CD wounded .
other notable australian actions included slingersfontein , pink hill , rhenosterkop and haartebeestefontein .
australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war .
on CD june CD , the 5th victorian mounted rifles lost CD killed and CD wounded at wilmansrust , near middleburg after poor security allowed a force of CD boers to surprise them .
on CD october CD , victorians of the scottish horse regiment also suffered heavy casualties at gun hill , although CD boers were also killed in the engagement .
meanwhile , at onverwacht on CD january CD , the 5th queensland imperial bushmen lost CD killed and CD wounded .
ultimately the boers were defeated , and the war ended on CD may CD .
in all CD CD australians served in south africa , and perhaps another CD CD enlisted as individuals in imperial units .
casualties included CD killed in action , CD died of disease and CD missing in action , while a further CD were wounded .
CD australians were awarded the victoria cross .
the boxer rebellion in china began in CD , and a number of western nations including many european powers , the united states , and japan soon sent forces as part of the china field force to protect their interests .
in june , the british government sought permission from the australian colonies to dispatch ships from the australian squadron to china .
the colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in south africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower .
the force dispatched was a modest one , with britain accepting CD men from victoria , CD from new south wales and the south australian ship hmcs protector , under the command of captain william creswell .
most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists , who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role .
amongst the naval contingent from new south wales were CD naval officers and sailors and CD permanent soldiers headquartered at victoria barracks , sydney who originally enlisted for the second boer war .
the soldiers were keen to go to china but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the new south wales naval brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks .
the army and navy compromised and titled the contingent the nsw marine light infantry .
the contingents from new south wales and victoria sailed for china on CD august CD .
arriving in tientsin , the australians provided CD men to an CD CD strong multinational force tasked with capturing the chinese forts at pei tang , which dominated a key railway .
they arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at pao ting fu , where the chinese government was believed to have found asylum after peking was captured by western forces .
the victorians joined a force of CD CD men on a CD day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered .
the victorians then garrisoned tientsin and the new south wales contingent undertook garrison duties in peking .
hmcs protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and courier duties in the gulf of chihli , before departing in november .
the naval brigades remained during the winter , unhappily performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as railwaymen and fire fighters .
they left china in march CD , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order .
CD australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action .
the commonwealth of australia came into existence on CD january CD as a result of the federation of the australian colonies .
under the constitution of australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government .
the australian commonwealth military forces came into being on CD march CD and all the colonial forces including those still in south africa became part of the new force .
CD CD colonial soldiers , including CD CD professional soldiers , CD CD paid militia and CD CD unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred .
the individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial acts until the defence act CD brought all the units under CD piece of legislation .
this act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside australia .
however , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the citizen military forces cmf .
major general sir edward hutton a former commander of the new south wales military forces subsequently became the first commander of the commonwealth military forces on CD december and set to work devising an integrated structure for the new army .
in CD , following a report by lord kitchener the royal military college , duntroon was established , as was a system of universal national service .
prior to federation each self governing colony had operated its own naval force .
these navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to subsidise the cost of a british naval squadron in their waters for decades .
the colonies maintained control over their respective navies until CD march CD , when the commonwealth naval force was created .
this new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in australian naval policy .
in CD prime minister alfred deakin and creswell , while attending the imperial conference in london , sought the british government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an australian navy .
the admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient .
deakin was unimpressed , and in CD invited the american great white fleet to visit australia .
this visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of CD CD ton river class destroyers .
the surge in german naval construction prompted the admiralty to change their position however and the royal australian navy was subsequently formed in CD , absorbing the commonwealth naval force .
on CD october CD , the new fleet steamed through sydney heads , consisting of the battlecruiser hmas australia , CD light cruisers , and CD destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction .
and as a consequence the navy entered the first world war as a formidable force .
regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments .
this was itself in part due to the large number of british born citizens and first generation anglo australians that made up the australian population at the time .
indeed , by the end of the war almost CD of those who served in the australian forces had been born in britain .
as the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the defence act CD , an all volunteer expeditionary force known as the australian imperial force aif was formed and recruitment began on CD august CD .
the government pledged CD CD men , organised as CD infantry division and CD light horse brigade plus supporting units .
enlistment and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in CD .
the first commander was major general william bridges , who also assumed command of the 1st division .
throughout the course of the conflict australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed .
following the outbreak of war australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of germany 's pacific colonies .
the australian naval and military expeditionary force an mef , a CD man volunteer force separate from the aif and consisting of an infantry battalion plus CD naval reservists and ex sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of william holmes .
the objectives of the force were the wireless stations on nauru , and those at yap in the caroline islands , and at rabaul in german new guinea .
the force reached rabaul on CD september CD and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the german and native defenders during fighting at bita paka and toma .
german new guinea surrendered on CD september CD .
australian losses were light , including CD killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine ae1 with all CD men aboard .
the aif departed by ship in a single convoy from albany on CD november CD .
during the journey CD of the convoy 's naval escorts hmas sydney engaged and destroyed the german cruiser sms emden at the battle of cocos on CD november , in the first ship to ship action involving the royal australian navy .
aiming to knock turkey out of the war the british then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the australians were included amongst the british , indian and french forces committed to the campaign .
the combined australian and new zealand army corps anzac commanded by british general william birdwood subsequently landed at anzac cove on the gallipoli peninsula on CD april CD .
although promising to transform the war if successful , the gallipoli campaign was ill conceived and ultimately lasted CD months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives .
australian casualties totalled CD CD , including CD CD killed .
for australians and new zealanders the gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity .
after the withdrawal from gallipoli the australians returned to egypt and the aif underwent a major expansion .
in CD the infantry began to move to france while the cavalry units remained in the middle east to fight the turks .
australian troops of the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division saw action in all the major battles of the sinai and palestine campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the turkish troops that were threatening british control of egypt .
the australian 's first saw combat during the senussi uprising in the libyan desert and the nile valley , during which the combined british forces successfully put down the primitive pro turkish islamic sect with heavy casualties .
the anzac mounted division subsequently saw considerable action in the battle of romani against the turkish between CD CD august CD , with the turks eventually pushed back .
following this victory the british forces went on the offensive in the sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the suez canal .
rafa was captured on CD january CD , while the last of the small turkish garrisons in the sinai were eliminated in february .
the advance entered palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture gaza on CD march CD , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on CD april .
a third assault occurred between CD october and CD november and this time both the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division took part .
the battle was a complete success for the british , over running the gaza beersheba line and capturing CD CD turkish soldiers .
the critical moment was the capture of beersheba on the first day , after the australian 4th light horse brigade charged more than CD miles CD CD km .
the turkish trenches were overrun , with the australians capturing the wells at beersheeba and securing the valuable water they contained along with over CD prisoners for the loss of CD killed and CD wounded .
later , australian troops assisted in pushing the turkish forces out of palestine and took part in actions at mughar ridge , jerusalem and the megiddo .
the turkish government surrendered on CD october CD .
units of the light horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in egypt in CD and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process .
meanwhile , the afc had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the dominions .
deploying just a single aircraft to german new guinea in CD , the first operational flight did not occur until CD may CD however , when the mesopotamian half flight was called upon to assist in protecting british oil interests in iraq .
the afc was soon expanded and CD squadrons later saw action in egypt , palestine and on the western front , where they performed well .
CD infantry divisions of the aif saw action in france and belgium , leaving egypt in march CD .
i anzac corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of armentières on CD april CD and for the next CD and a half years the aif participated in most of the major battles on the western front , earning a formidable reputation .
although spared from the disastrous first day of the battle of the somme , within weeks CD australian divisions had been committed .
the 5th division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the battle of fromelles on CD july CD , suffering CD CD casualties in a single day .
the 1st division entered the line on CD july , assaulting pozieres , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd division on CD july , they had suffered CD CD casualties .
mouquet farm was attacked in august , with casualties totalling CD CD men .
by the time the aif was withdrawn from the somme to re organise , they had suffered CD CD casualties in just CD days .
in march CD , the 2nd and 5th divisions pursued the germans back to the hindenburg line , capturing the town of bapaume .
on CD april , the 4th division assaulted the hindenburg line in the disastrous first battle of bullecourt , losing over CD CD casualties and CD CD captured .
on CD april , the 1st and 2nd divisions were counter attacked near lagnicourt and were forced to abandon the town , before recapturing it again .
the 2nd division then took part in the second battle of bullecourt , beginning on CD may , and succeeded in taking sections of the hindenburg line and holding them until relieved by the 1st division .
finally , on CD may the 5th division relieved the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid may .
combined these efforts cost CD CD australian casualties .
on CD june CD , the ii anzac corps along with CD british corps launched an operation in flanders to eliminate a salient south of ypres .
the attack commenced with the detonation of a CD pounds CD CD kg of explosives that had been placed underneath the messines ridge , destroying the german trenches .
the advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong german counterattacks the next day , it succeeded .
australian casualties during the battle of messines included nearly CD CD men .
i anzac corps then took part in the third battle of ypres in belgium as part of the campaign to capture the gheluvelt plateau , between september and november CD .
individual actions took place at menin road , polygon wood , broodseinde , poelcappelle and passchendaele and over the course of CD weeks fighting the australians suffered CD CD casualties .
on CD march CD the german army launched its spring offensive in a last ditched effort to win the war , unleashing CD CD divisions over a CD miles CD km front .
as the allies fell back the 3rd and 4th divisions were rushed south to amiens on the somme .
the offensive lasted for the next CD months and all CD aif divisions in france were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide .
by late may the germans had pushed to within CD miles CD km of paris .
during this time the australians fought at dernacourt , morlancourt , villers bretonneux , hangard wood , hazebrouck , and hamel .
at hamel the commander of the australian corps , lieutenant general john monash , successfully used combined arms including aircraft , artillery and armour in an attack for the first time .
the german offensive ground to a halt in mid july and a brief lull followed , during which the australians undertook a series of raids , known as peaceful penetrations .
the allies soon launched their own offensive the hundred days offensive ultimately ending the war .
beginning on CD august CD the offensive included CD australian divisions striking at amiens .
using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the black day of the german army .
the offensive continued for CD months , and during second battle of the somme the australian corps fought actions at lihons , etinehem , proyart , chuignes , and mont st quentin , before their final engagement of the war on CD october CD at montbrehain .
the aif was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on CD november CD .
in all CD CD australians enlisted in the aif during the war and CD CD served overseas .
CD CD were killed and another CD CD were wounded a total casualty rate of CD .
the financial cost to the australian government was calculated at CD CD CD .
CD referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting .
consequently , australia remained CD of only CD armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war .
the war had a profound effect on australian society in other ways also .
indeed , for many australians the nation 's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war .
CD australians were awarded the victoria cross during the first world war .
the russian civil war began after the russian provisional government collapsed and the bolshevik party assumed power in october CD .
following the end of the first world war , the western powers including britain intervened , giving half hearted support to the pro tsarist , anti bolshevik white russian forces .
although the australian government refused to commit forces , many australians serving with the british army became involved in the fighting .
a small number served as advisors to white russian units with the north russian expeditionary force nref .
awaiting repatriation in england , about CD australians subsequently enlisted in the british north russia relief force nrrf , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed .
the royal australian navy destroyer hmas swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the black sea in late CD .
other australians served as advisers with the british military mission to the white russian general , anton denikin in south russia , while several more advised admiral aleksandr kolchak in siberia .
later , they also served in mesopotamia as part of dunsterforce and the malleson mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing turkish access to the middle east and india , and did little fighting .
although the motivations of those australian 's that volunteered to fight in russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political .
regardless , they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage , winning the only CD victoria crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers .
yet australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war .
total casualties included CD killed and CD wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in mesopotamia .
in october CD , hmas adelaide was called to the british solomon islands protectorate as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and CD others by kwaio natives at sinalagu on the island of malaita on CD october , known as the malaita massacre .
arriving at tulagi on CD october , the ship proceeded to malaita to protect the landing of CD platoons of troops , then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the killers .
the ship 's personnel took no part in operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support .
adelaide returned to australia on CD november .
a small number of australian volunteers fought on both sides of the spanish civil war , although they predominantly supported the spanish republic through the international brigades .
the australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other nationalities , such as the british battalion and the lincoln battalion , rather than forming their own units .
most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were spanish born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin .
at least CD australians volunteered , with only CD nugent bull , a conservative catholic who was later killed serving in the raf during the second world war known to have fought for general francisco franco 's nationalist forces .
while a celebrated because for the australian left particularly the communist party of australia and the trade union movement the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality .
australian opposition to the republican because was marshalled by b.a. santamaria on an anti communist basis , rather than a pro nationalist basis .
equally , although individual right wing australians may have served with the nationalist rebels , they received no public support .
service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of australians travelling to spain to enlist , no action was taken .
consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the returned and services league of australia rsl .
although the number of australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least CD were killed .
australia entered the second world war on CD september CD .
at the time of the declaration of war against germany the australian military was small and unready for war .
recruiting for a second australian imperial force 2nd aif began in mid september .
while there was no rush of volunteers like the first world war , a high proportion of australian men of military age had enlisted by mid CD .
CD infantry divisions were formed during CD and CD , CD of which were dispatched to the middle east .
the raaf 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the commonwealth air forces through the empire air training scheme eats , through which almost CD CD australians were trained during the war .
the australian military 's first major engagements of the war were against italian forces in the mediterranean and north africa .
during CD the light cruiser hmas sydney and CD elderly destroyers dubbed the scrap iron flotilla by nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels a title proudly accepted by the ships took part in a series of operations as part of the british mediterranean fleet , and sank several italian warships .
the army first saw action in january CD , when the 6th division formed part of the commonwealth forces during operation compass .
the division assaulted and captured bardia on CD january and tobruk on CD january , with tens of thousands of italian troops surrendering at both towns .
the 6th division took part in the pursuit of the italian army and captured benghazi on CD february .
in late february it was withdrawn for service in greece , and was replaced by the 9th division .
the australian forces in the mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during CD .
during april , the 6th division , other elements of i corps and several australian warships formed part of the allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend greece from german invasion during the battle of greece .
at the end of this campaign , the 6th division was evacuated to egypt and crete .
the force at crete subsequently fought in the battle of crete during may , which also ended in defeat for the allies .
over CD CD australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat .
the germans and italians also went on the offensive in north africa at the end of march and drove the commonwealth force there back to near the border with egypt .
the 9th division and a brigade of the 7th division were besieged at tobruk .
successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by british units in october .
during june , the main body of the 7th division , a brigade of the 6th division and the i corps headquarters took part in the syria lebanon campaign against the vichy french .
resistance was stronger than expected .
australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the french capitulated in early july .
the majority of australian units in the mediterranean returned to australia in early CD , after the outbreak of the pacific war .
the 9th division was the largest unit to remain in the middle east , and played a key role in the first battle of el alamein during june and the second battle of el alamein in october .
the division returned to australia in early CD , but several raaf squadrons and ran warships took part in the subsequent tunisia campaign and the italian campaign from CD until the end of the war .
the raaf 's role in the strategic air offensive in europe formed australia 's main contribution to the defeat of germany .
approximately CD CD australian airmen served in dozens of british and CD australian squadrons in raf bomber command between CD and the end of the war .
australians took part in all of bomber command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on german cities and targets in france .
australian aircrew in bomber command had CD of the highest casualty rates of any part of the australian military during the second world war and sustained almost CD percent of all australian deaths in combat .
CD CD were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner .
australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of western europe during CD and CD and CD raaf maritime patrol squadrons served in the battle of the atlantic .
from the CD australia 's defence thinking was dominated by british imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the singapore strategy .
this strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at singapore from which a large british fleet would respond to japanese aggression in the region .
to this end , a high proportion of australian forces in asia were concentrated in malaya during CD and CD as the threat from japan increased .
however , as a result of the emphasis on co operation with britain , relatively few australian military units had been retained in australia and the asia pacific region .
measures were taken to improve australia 's defences as war with japan loomed in CD , but these proved inadequate .
in december CD , the australian army in the pacific comprised the 8th division , most of which was stationed in malaya , and CD partially trained and equipped divisions in australia .
the raaf was equipped with CD aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the ran had CD cruisers and CD destroyers in australian waters .
the australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the pacific war .
the 8th division and raaf squadrons in malaya formed a part of the british commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller japanese invasion force which landed on CD december .
the british commonwealth force withdrew to singapore at the end of january , but was forced to surrender on CD february after the japanese captured much of the island .
smaller australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early CD at rabaul , and in ambon , timor , and java .
the australian town of darwin was heavily bombed by the japanese on CD february , to prevent it from being used as an allied base .
over CD CD australians were taken prisoner in early CD and endured harsh conditions in japanese captivity .
the prisoners were subjected to malnutrition , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards .
as a result , CD CD australian prisoners died in captivity .
the rapid allied defeat in the pacific caused many australians to fear that the japanese would invade the australian mainland .
this fact was not known by the allies at the time , and the australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion .
large numbers of united states army and army air forces units arrived in australia in early CD , and the australian military was placed under the overall command of general douglas macarthur in march .
australians played a central role in the new guinea campaign during CD and CD .
after an attempt to land troops at port moresby was defeated in the battle of the coral sea , the japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the owen stanley ranges and milne bay .
australian army units defeated these offensives in the kokoda track campaign and battle of milne bay with the support of the raaf and usaaf .
australian and us army units subsequently assaulted and captured the japanese bases on the north coast of papua in the hard fought battle of buna gona .
the australian army also defeated a japanese attempt to capture the town of wau in january CD and went onto the offensive in the salamaua lae campaign in april .
in late CD , the 7th and 9th divisions played an important role in operation cartwheel , when they landed to the east and west of lae and secured the huon peninsula during the huon peninsula campaign and finisterre range campaign .
the australian mainland came under attack during CD and CD .
japanese submarines operated off australia from may to august CD and january to june CD .
these attacks sought to cut the allied supply lines between australia and the us and australia and new guinea , but were unsuccessful .
japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against allied bases in northern australia which were being used to mount the north western area campaign against japanese positions in the netherlands east indies nei .
australia 's role in the pacific war declined from CD .
the increasing size of the us forces in the pacific rendered the australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production .
nevertheless , the government wanted the australian military to remain active , and agreed to macarthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns .
in late CD , australian troops and raaf squadrons replaced us garrisons in eastern new guinea , new britain , and bougainville , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining japanese forces there .
in may CD , i corps , the australian first tactical air force and usaaf and usn units began the borneo campaign , which continued until the end of the war .
these campaigns contributed little to japan 's defeat and remain controversial .
following japan 's surrender on CD august CD australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of borneo and the eastern netherlands east indies until british and dutch colonial rule was restored .
australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of japanese personnel .
CD CD australians enlisted during the war , while CD CD served overseas .
casualties included CD CD killed and another CD CD were wounded .
CD victoria crosses were awarded to australians .
the demobilisation of the australian military following the end of the second world war was completed in CD .
plans for post war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force .
it was envisioned that the royal australian navy maintaining a fleet that would include CD light fleet carriers , CD cruisers , CD destroyers , CD others ships in commission and another CD in reserved .
the royal australian air force would have a strength of CD squadrons , including CD manned by the citizen air force .
the australian regular army was subsequently formed on CD september CD , while the cmf was re raised on CD july CD .
in the immediate post war period australia contributed significant forces to the allied occupation of japan as part of the british commonwealth occupation force bcof , which included forces from australia , britain , india and new zealand .
at its height in CD the australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , CD warships and CD fighter squadrons , totalling CD CD personnel .
the australian army component initially consisted of the 34th brigade which arrived in japan in february CD and was based in hiroshima prefecture .
the CD infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the royal australian regiment in CD , and the 34th brigade became the 1st brigade when it returned to australia in december CD , forming the basis of the post war regular army .
from that time the australian army contribution to the occupation of japan was reduced to a single under strength battalion .
australian forces remained until september CD when the bcof ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the korean peninsular following the outbreak of the korean war in CD .
the raaf component consisted of nos. CD , CD and CD squadrons as part of no. CD wing raaf flying p CD mustangs , initially based at bofu from march CD , before transferring to iwakuni in CD .
however , by CD only no. CD squadron remained in japan .
a total of CD ran warships served in japan during this period , including hma ships australia , hobart , shropshire , arunta , bataan , culgoa , murchison , shoalhaven , quadrant and quiberon , while hmas ships manoora , westralia and kanimbla also provided support .
the middle east was considered the most likely area of operations for australian forces , where they would most likely operate with british forces .
early commitments included the involvement of raaf aircrew during the berlin airlift in CD CD and the deployment of no. CD wing raaf to malta in the mediterranean from CD to CD .
meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a national service scheme in CD to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the army , raaf and ran .
on CD june CD , the north korean army kpa crossed the border into south korea and advanced for the capital seoul , which fell in less than a week .
north korean forces continued toward the port of pusan and CD days later the united states offered its assistance to south korea .
in response the united nations security council requested members to assist in repelling the north korean attack .
australia initially contributed p CD mustang fighter bomber aircraft from no. CD squadron raaf and infantry from the 3rd battalion , royal australian regiment CD rar , both of which were stationed in japan as part of the bcof .
in addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the british commonwealth forces korea .
the ran frigate hmas shoalhaven , and the destroyer hmas bataan , were also committed .
later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard hmas sydney was added to the force .
by the time CD rar arrived in pusan on CD september , the north koreans were in retreat following the inchon landings .
as a part of the invasion force under the un supreme commander , general douglas macarthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at battle of yongju near pyongyang on CD october , before advancing towards the yalu river .
further successful actions followed at kujin on CD CD october CD and at chongju on CD october CD .
north korean casualties were heavy , while australian losses included their commanding officer , lieutenant colonel charles green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died CD days later on CD november .
meanwhile , during the last weeks of october the chinese had moved CD divisions of the people 's volunteer army across the yalu river to reinforce the remnants of the kpa .
undetected by us and south korean intelligence , the 13th army group crossed the border on CD october and penetrated up to CD kilometres CD mi into north korea , and were reinforced in early november by CD divisions from the 9th army group .
in total CD divisions composed of CD CD men .
CD rar fought its first action against the chinese at pakchon on CD november .
the fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake .
following the chinese intervention , the un forces were defeated in successive battles and CD rar was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel .
a series of battles followed at uijeongbu on CD CD january CD , as the british and australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the south korean capital .
further fighting occurred at chuam ni on CD CD february CD following another chinese advance , and later at maehwa san between CD CD march CD as the un resumed the offensive .
australian troops subsequently participated in CD more major battles in CD , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the battle of kapyong .
on CD april , chinese forces attacked the kapyong valley and forced the south korean defenders to withdraw .
australian and canadian troops were ordered to halt this chinese advance .
after a night of fighting the australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of CD men killed and CD wounded .
in july CD , the australian battalion became part of the combined canadian , british , australian , new zealand , and indian 1st commonwealth division .
the second major battle took place during operation commando and occurred after the chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the imjin river .
the 1st commonwealth division counter attacked on CD october , capturing a number of objectives including hill CD and hill CD during the battle of maryang san .
after CD days the chinese retreated .
australian casualties included CD dead and CD wounded .
the belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the first world war , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences .
from CD until the end of the war , CD rar held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the imjin river .
across from them were heavily fortified chinese positions .
in march CD , australia increased its ground commitment to CD battalions , sending CD rar .
this battalion remained in korea for CD months , before being replaced by CD rar in april CD .
the australians fought their last battle during CD CD july CD , with CD rar holding off a concerted chinese attack along the samichon river and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of CD killed and CD wounded .
hostilities were suspended on CD july CD .
CD CD australians served during the war , with CD killed , CD CD wounded and CD captured .
the malayan emergency was declared on CD june CD , after CD estate managers were murdered by members of the malayan communist party mcp .
australian involvement began in june CD , when in response to a british request , CD lincolns from no. 1 squadron and a flight of dakotas from no. CD squadron arrived in singapore to form part of the british commonwealth far east air force feaf .
the dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as paratroop and leaflet drops , while the lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the communist terrorist ct jungle bases .
the raaf were particularly successful , and in CD such mission known as operation termite , CD lincoln bombers destroyed CD communist camps , killed CD communists and forced CD into surrender , in a joint operation with the raf and ground troops .
the lincolns were withdrawn in CD , and were replaced by canberra bombers from no. CD squadron and cac sabres from no. CD wing .
based at raaf base butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas .
australian ground forces were deployed to malaya in october CD as part of the far east strategic reserve .
in january CD , the first australian ground forces were deployed on malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd battalion , royal australian regiment CD rar .
CD rar mainly participated in mopping up operations over the next CD months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the ct jungle bases , as part of 28th british commonwealth brigade .
contact with the enemy was infrequent and results small , achieving relatively few kills .
CD rar left malaysia october CD to be replaced by CD rar .
CD rar underwent CD weeks of jungle training and began driving mcp insurgents back into the jungle of perak and kedah .
the new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes .
again contact was limited , although CD rar had more success than its predecessor .
by late CD , operations against the mcp were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the thailand border .
CD rar left malaysia october CD and was replaced by CD rar .
though patrolling the border CD rar did not make contact with the insurgents , and in october CD it was replaced by CD rar , which stayed in malaysia until august CD .
the malayan emergency officially ended on CD july CD .
australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air field construction squadron .
the royal australian navy also served in malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between CD and CD .
the emergency was the longest continued commitment in australian military history .
CD CD australians served and CD died in malaya although only CD were on operations and another CD were wounded .
at the start of the 1960s , prime minister robert menzies greatly expanded the australian military so that it could carry out the government 's policy of forward defence in south east asia .
in CD , menzies announced a large increase in defence spending .
the strength of the australian army would be increased by CD over CD years from CD CD to CD CD .
providing a full CD brigade division with CD battalions .
the raaf and ran would also both be increased by CD .
in CD , conscription or national service was re introduced under the national service act , for selected CD year olds based on date of birth , for a period of CD years continuous full time service the previous scheme having been suspended in CD .
in CD , CD charles f. adams class destroyers were purchased from the united states to replace the ageing q class destroyers .
traditionally , the ran had purchased designs based on those of the royal navy and the purchase of american destroyers was significant .
hmas perth and hmas hobart joined the fleet in CD , followed by hmas brisbane in CD .
other projects included the construction of CD river class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier hmas melbourne to an anti submarine role , the acquisition of CD wessex helicopters , and the purchase of CD oberon class submarines .
the raaf took delivery of their first mirage fighters in CD , equipping no. CD , no. CD and no. CD squadrons with them .
the service also received american f CD strike aircraft , c CD hercules transports , p CD orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and italian macchi trainers .
the indonesia malaysia confrontation was fought from CD to CD between the british commonwealth and indonesia over the creation of the federation of malaysia , with the commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state .
the war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of borneo , although a number of indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the malay peninsula did occur .
as part of australia 's continuing military commitment to the security of malaysia , army , naval and airforce units were based there as part of the far east strategic reserve .
regardless the australian government was wary of involvement in a war with indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the malayan peninsula only .
on CD occasions australian troops from CD rar were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at labis and pontian , in september and october CD .
following these raids the government conceded to british and malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to borneo .
during the early phases , british and malaysian troops had attempted only to control the malaysian indonesian border , and to protect population centres .
however , by the time the australian battalion deployed the british had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the indonesians to remain on the defensive , under the codename operation claret .
CD rar deployed to borneo in march CD , and served in sarawak until the end of july , operating on both sides of the border .
the battalion had CD major contacts with indonesian forces and several smaller ones including at sungei koemba , kindau and babang during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the indonesians as well as suffering casualties in CD mine incidents .
CD rar served a less eventful tour between april and august CD , and also operated over the border , successfully clashing with the indonesians on a number of occasions .
a squadron of the special air service regiment sasr was also deployed in CD and again in CD , taking part in cross border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the indonesians , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance .
other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of ran ships were involved in shelling indonesian positions in borneo and in repelling infiltrators in the singapore strait .
the raaf played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated .
operations in borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross border missions only occurred in CD .
following a military coup in indonesia in early CD which brought general suharto to power , a peace treaty was signed in august CD which ended the conflict .
CD CD australians served during confrontation .
casualties included CD dead , with CD killed in action and CD wounded .
australia 's involvement in the vietnam war was driven largely by the rise of communism in southeast asia after the second world war , and the fear of its spread which developed in australia during the 1950s and early 1960s .
as a consequence , australia supported south vietnam throughout the early 1960s .
in CD and CD , the leader of the south vietnamese government , ngo dinh diem , asked for assistance from the us and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist north vietnam .
australia offered CD military advisors from the australian army training team vietnam , which became known simply as the team .
they arrived in july and august CD , beginning australia 's involvement in the war .
later in august CD , the raaf sent a flight of caribou transport aircraft to the port city of vung tau .
however , with the security situation in south vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the us increased its involvement to CD CD combat troops by early CD .
australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the CD rar to serve with the us 173rd airborne brigade in bien hoa province in june CD and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including gang toi , operation crimp and suoi bong trang .
in march CD , the australian government announced the deployment of a brigade sized unit the 1st australian task force CD atf to replace CD rar .
included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial national service scheme .
consisting of CD infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at nui dat , in phuoc tuy province .
included were the iroquois helicopters of no. CD squadron raaf .
at the battle of long tan on CD august CD , d company , CD rar with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a viet cong force that was at least CD times bigger than itself .
CD australians were killed and CD wounded , while CD communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield .
the battle allowed the australians to gain dominance over phuoc tuy province and CD atf was not fundamentally challenged again .
regardless , during february CD the australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing CD men killed and CD wounded in a single week , the bulk during operation bribie .
yet with the phuoc tuy province coming progressively under control throughout CD , the australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield .
CD atf was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of operation coburg during the CD tet offensive and later during the battle of coral balmoral in may and june CD .
at fire support bases coral and balmoral the australians had clashed with regular north vietnamese army and viet cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war .
during CD days of fighting australian casualties included CD killed and CD wounded , while communist casualties included CD killed confirmed by body count , CD possibly killed , CD wounded and CD captured .
other significant australian actions included binh ba in june CD , hat dich in late december CD and early CD and long khanh in june CD .
at the height of the australian commitment , CD atf numbered CD CD troops , including CD infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support .
a third raaf unit , no. CD squadron raaf , flying canberra bombers , was sent in CD , and CD ran destroyers joined us patrols in the waters off north vietnam .
the australian withdrawal effectively commenced in november CD .
as a consequence of the overall allied strategy of vietnamization and with the australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , CD rar was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty .
CD atf was again reduced to just CD infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining .
australian combat forces were further reduced during CD as part of a phased withdrawal , and CD atf ceased operations in october .
meanwhile , the advisors remained to train south vietnamese troops until withdrawn on CD december CD by the newly elected labor government of gough whitlam .
the last australian forces were finally withdrawn in CD .
the vietnam war was australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti war movement developed .
more than CD CD australians served in vietnam .
CD were killed and CD CD were wounded .
CD were awarded the victoria cross .
the need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the australian military 's experiences in the vietnam war .
in CD , the secretary of the department of defence , arthur tange , submitted a report to the government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of chief of the defence force staff .
the whitlam labor government subsequently amalgamated the CD defence ministries defence , navy , army , air force , and supply into a single department of defence in CD , while conscription under the national service scheme was abolished .
on CD january CD , the CD branches of the australian military were brought together as a unified , all volunteer , professional force known as the australian defence force adf .
today , the adf is headquartered at russell offices in canberra and is divided into air , land , maritime and special operations commands .
in addition , northern command is based in darwin , and is responsible for operations in northern australia .
until the 1970s , australia 's military strategy centred on the concept of forward defence , in which the role of australian military and naval forces were to co operate with allied forces to counter threats in australia 's region .
following the adoption of the guam doctrine by the united states in CD , and the british withdrawal east of suez in the early 1970s , australia developed a defence policy emphasising self reliance and the defence of the australian continent .
known as the defence of australia policy , it focused australian defence planning on protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches the air sea gap against possible attack .
in line with this goal , the adf was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from australian bases and to counter raids on continental australia .
this was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the ran and raaf , and relocating regular army units to northern australia .
during this time the adf had no military units on operational deployment outside australia .
however , in CD the adf made its first operational deployment as part of operation morris dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off fiji in response to the CD fijian coups d 'état .
while broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the adf to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events .
during this period australia continued to retain forces in malaysia as part of the five power defence arrangements fpda agreed in CD to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces .
however , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from singapore in CD , and the CD mirage fighter squadrons in CD .
since then a detachment of orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as rifle company butterworth have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of f a CD hornet fighter aircraft .
australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout asian waters in the last decades of the cold war .
airforce and navy units were also involved in tracking soviet ship and submarine movements in the region .
since then the orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of operation gateway , conducting patrols over the indian ocean , strait of malacca and south china sea .
they have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights .
australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the CD gulf war , deploying a naval task group of CD warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team .
in total about CD personnel .
the australian contribution was the first time australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the adf and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure .
however , the australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against iraq following the invasion of kuwait .
some adf personnel serving on exchange with british and american units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions .
following the war , the navy regularly deployed a frigate to the persian gulf or red sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to iraq .
a number of australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with us and british air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no fly zones imposed over iraq between CD and CD .
since the late 1980s , the australian government had increasingly called upon the adf to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world .
while most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel .
large peacekeeping deployments were made to namibia in early CD , cambodia between CD and CD , somalia in CD , rwanda between CD and CD and bougainville in CD and from CD onwards .
in line with this new focus , the adf 's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the adf 's combat effectiveness .
the former portuguese colony of east timor was invaded by indonesia in CD , however , following years of violent struggle the new indonesian government of president b.j. habibie subsequently agreed to allow the east timorese to vote on autonomy in CD .
the united nations mission in east timor unamet was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of august CD and resulted with CD CD of voters deciding in favour of independence .
however , following the announcement of the results pro indonesian militias supported by elements of the indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and arson and many east timorese were killed , while perhaps more than CD CD were displaced .
unable to control the violence , indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force .
australia , which had contributed police to unamet , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the international force for east timor interfet , a non un force operating in accordance with un resolutions .
the total size of the australian force committed numbered CD CD personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of australian forces since CD .
under the overall command of australian major general peter cosgrove , interfet began arriving on CD september CD and was tasked with restoring peace and security , protecting and supporting unamet , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations .
with the withdrawal of the indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from east timor , unamet re established its headquarters in dili on CD september .
on CD october CD , indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a un peacekeeping force , the united nations transitional administration in east timor untaet was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of east timor during its transition to independence .
the hand over of command of military operations from interfet to untaet was completed on CD february CD .
australia continued to support the un peacekeeping operation with between CD CD and CD CD personnel , as well as landing craft and blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission .
during these operations australian forces regularly clashed with pro indonesian militia and on a number of occasions indonesian forces as well , especially along the border with west timor .
significant actions occurred in suai , CD and at aidabasalala in october CD .
however , with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the australian and un forces were withdrawn by CD .
CD australians died from non battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action .
the unexpected deployment to east timor in CD led to significant changes in australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the adf 's ability to conduct operations outside australia .
this successful deployment was the first time a large australian military force had operated outside of australia since the vietnam war and revealed shortcomings in the adf 's ability to mount and sustain such operations .
in response , the CD defence white paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the adf for overseas deployments .
the australian government committed to improve the adf 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of adf units , expanding the adf to CD CD full time personnel and increasing real defence expenditure by CD per year .
in may CD , CD CD adf personnel were again deployed to east timor as part of operation astute , following unrest between elements of the timor leste defence force .
australian forces were involved in a number skirmishes during this time , including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by alfredo reinado at same on CD march CD .
however , by early CD the security situation had been stabilised and just CD australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force .
following a drawdown , the international stabilisation force commenced withdrawing from timor leste in november CD , a process which was completed in april CD .
shortly after the islamist inspired terrorist attacks in new york and washington on CD september CD , australian forces were committed to the american led international coalition against terrorism .
the adf 's most visible contribution codenamed operation slipper has been a special forces task group operating in afghanistan from CD to CD and again from mid CD to fight against the taliban .
over time the australian commitment has grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a reconstruction task force from CD to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the afghan national army .
australia has also contributed a frigate and CD ap 3c orion surveillance aircraft and CD c CD hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean since CD , supporting both the operations in afghanistan and those in iraq under operation catalyst .
a special operations task group was deployed to support the reconstruction taskforce in april CD .
a modest force remained in afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter insurgency operations in uruzgan province in conjunction united states and other coalition forces , including the dutch prior to their withdrawal .
the force consisted of motorised infantry , special forces , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements .
in addition , a further CD australian logistic personnel were also based in the middle east in support , but are located outside of afghanistan .
meanwhile , detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in iraq and afghanistan , based out of al minhad air base in the united arab emirates .
also included is the deployment of CD of the ran 's frigates to the arabian sea and gulf of aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties .
australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included operation anaconda in CD and operation perth in CD , as well as actions in chora in CD , kakarak in CD , the shah wali kot and derapet in CD , and doan in CD .
although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements .
casualties include CD killed and CD wounded , while another australian also died serving with the british army .
CD australians have been awarded the victoria cross for australia , the first such decorations in CD years .
following a drawdown in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on CD december CD .
however , approximately CD personnel remain in afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in kandahar and kabul .
over CD CD australian personnel have served in afghanistan .
australian forces later joined british and american forces during the CD invasion of iraq .
the initial contribution was also a modest one , consisting of just CD CD personnel codenamed operation falconer .
major force elements included special forces , rotary and fixed wing aviation and naval units .
army units included elements from the sasr and 4th battalion , royal australian regiment commando , a ch CD chinook detachment and a number of other specialist units .
ran units included the amphibious ship hmas kanimbla and the frigates hmas darwin and hmas anzac , while the raaf deployed CD f a CD hornets from no. CD squadron , a number of ap 3c orions and c CD hercules .
the australian special forces task force was CD of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into iraq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to baghdad were from the sasr .
during the invasion the raaf also flew its first combat missions since the vietnam war , with no. CD squadron flying a total of CD sorties and dropping CD laser guided bombs .
the iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power , and with their defeat the bulk of australian forces were withdrawn .
while australia did not initially take part in the post war occupation of iraq , an australian army light armoured battlegroup designated the al muthanna task group and including CD aslav light armoured vehicles and infantry was later deployed to southern iraq in april CD as part of operation catalyst .
the role of this force was to protect the japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of new iraqi army units .
the amtg later became the overwatch battle group west obg w , following the hand back of al muthanna province to iraqi control .
force levels peaked at CD CD personnel in may CD including the obg w in southern iraq , the security detachment in baghdad and the australian army training team iraq .
a ran frigate was based in the north persian gulf , while raaf assets included c 130h hercules and ap 3c elements .
following the election of a new labor government under prime minister kevin rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid CD , while raaf and ran operations were redirected to other parts of the middle east area of operations as part of operation slipper .
low level operations continued , however , with a small australian force of CD soldiers remaining in iraq to protect the australian embassy in baghdad as part of secdet under operation kruger .
secdet was finally withdrawn in august CD , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for australia 's diplomatic presence in iraq .
although more than CD CD personnel served during operations in iraq , australian casualties were relatively light , with CD soldiers accidentally killed , while a third australian died serving with the british royal air force .
a further CD personnel were wounded .
CD officers remained in iraq attached to the united nations assistance mission for iraq as part of operation riverbank .
this operation concluded in november CD .
in june CD a small number of sasr personnel were deployed to iraq to protect the australian embassy when the security of baghdad was threatened by the CD northern iraq offensive .
later , in august and september a number of raaf c CD and c 130j transport aircraft based in the middle east were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in kurdish controlled northern iraq .
in late september CD an air task group atg and special operations task group sotg were deployed to al minhad air base in the united arab emirates as part of the coalition to combat islamic state forces in iraq .
equipped with f a CD super hornet strike aircraft , a kc CD multi role tanker transport , and an e 7a wedgetail airborne early warning control aircraft , the atg began operations on CD october .
the sotg is tasked with operations to advise and assist iraqi security forces , and was deployed to iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the australian and iraqi governments .
it began moving into iraq in early november .
in april CD a CD strong unit known as task group taji was deployed to iraq to train the regular iraqi security forces .
airstrikes were extended to syria in september CD .
australia 's involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse , and included participation in both united nations sponsored missions , as well as those as part of ad hoc coalitions .
australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as belligerents .
however in comparative international terms , australia has only been a moderately energetic peacekeeper .
CD significant commitment has been australia 's ongoing involvement with the long running multinational force and observers in the sinai .
the operational tempo started increasing in the mid 1990s , when australia became involved in a series of high profile operations , deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including cambodia , rwanda , somalia , east timor , and the solomon islands .
australia has been involved in close to CD separate missions , involving more than CD CD personnel .
CD australians have died during these operations .
ward leroy churchill born CD is an american author and political activist .
he was a professor of ethnic studies at the university of colorado boulder from CD until CD .
the primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and native americans by the united states government .
his work features controversial and provocative views , written in a direct , often confrontational style .
the essay is well known for churchill 's use of the phrase little eichmanns to describe the technocratic corps working in the world trade center .
in march CD the university of colorado began investigating allegations that churchill had engaged in research misconduct .
it reported in june CD that he had done so .
churchill was fired on july CD , CD , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the little eichmanns comment .
churchill filed a lawsuit against the university of colorado for unlawful termination of employment .
in april CD a denver jury found that churchill was wrongly fired , awarding him CD in damages .
in july CD , a district court judge vacated the monetary award and declined churchill 's request to order his reinstatement , deciding the university has quasi judicial immunity .
in february CD , churchill appealed the judge 's decision .
in november CD , the colorado court of appeals upheld the lower court 's ruling .
in september CD , CD , the colorado supreme court upheld the lower courts decisions in favor of the university of colorado .
on april CD , CD , the united states supreme court declined to hear the case .
in a february CD interview , churchill commented that after living more than CD years in the northern plains colorado region , he had relocated to atlanta , georgia in CD .
churchill also stated that he had a half dozen uncompleted books which he intended to finish and publish in the next CD years .
churchill was born in urbana , illinois , to jack leroy churchill and maralyn lucretia allen .
his parents divorced before he was CD , and he grew up in elmwood , where he attended local schools .
in CD , he was drafted into the united states army .
on his CD resume , he said he served as a public information specialist who wrote and edited the battalion newsletter and wrote news releases .
the post article also reported that churchill was politically radicalized as a result of his experiences in vietnam .
churchill told the post that he had spent some time at the chicago office of the students for a democratic society sds in the late 1960s , and briefly taught members of the weather underground how to build bombs and fire weapons .
in CD , the denver post reported that churchill 's military records show he was trained as a film projectionist and light truck driver , but they do not reflect paratrooper school or lrrp training .
the 75th ranger regiment association found no record of churchill having been a member of the unit , or a lrrp team .
churchill received his b.a. in technological communications in CD and m.a. in communications theory in CD , both from sangamon state university , now the university of illinois at springfield .
in CD , churchill began working at the university of colorado boulder as an affirmative action officer in the university administration .
he also lectured on american indian issues in the ethnic studies program .
in CD , the university of colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position .
the following year he was granted tenure in the communications department , without the usual CD year probationary period , after having been declined by the sociology and political science departments .
he has long been interested in issues associated with the dawes act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households .
connected with that was the federal government 's first use of blood quantum to define individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the dawes rolls .
since re establishing self governments , federally recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum .
some of his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part of the federal government 's policy of genocide against native americans .
in CD churchill discussed his views with david barsamian in an interview
you could say that CD CD years ago was the basis of blood quantum in ibero america .
but in anglo america , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the general allotment act , mid 1880s .
at that point they began to define indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least CD quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group .
you could not be an eighth cheyenne and an eighth arapaho and be an indian .
you had to be a quarter cheyenne or a quarter arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter .
the reason for this was quite clear .
they were identifying indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point .
if they ran out of indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus .
so it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of indianness that would minimize the number of indians that were available .
it was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to indianness in the first place .
it is become increasingly so ever since .
david barsamian december CD .
interview with ward churchill historical and current perspectives .
z magazine .
in CD , churchill moved to the new ethnic studies department of the university of colorado .
in CD , he was promoted to full professor .
he was selected as chairman of the department in june CD .
in january CD , during the controversy over his CD CD remarks , churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the university of colorado his term as chair was scheduled to expire in june of that year .
on may CD , CD , the investigative committee of the standing committee on research misconduct at the university of colorado concluded that churchill had committed multiple counts of academic misconduct , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and falsification .
on july CD , CD , churchill was fired for academic misconduct in an CD to CD vote by the university of colorado 's board of regents .
in CD , churchill stated , i am myself of muscogee and creek descent on my father 's side , cherokee on my mother 's , and am an enrolled member of the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians .
in CD , churchill wrote elsewhere that he is CD eighth creek and CD sixteenth cherokee .
in CD , churchill told the colorado daily that he was CD sixteenth creek and cherokee .
churchill told the denver post in february CD that he is CD sixteenths cherokee .
in a statement dated may CD , CD , and posted on its website , the united keetoowah band initially said ,
the united keetoowah band would like to make it clear that mr. churchill is not a member of the keetoowah band and was only given an honorary associate membership in the early 1990s because he could not prove any cherokee ancestry .
the tribe said that all of churchill 's past , present and future claims or assertions of keetoowah enrollment , written or spoken , including but not limited to .
biographies , curriculum vitae , lectures , applications for employment , or any other reference not listed herein , are deemed fraudulent by the united keetoowah band .
CD days later , the united keetoowah band replaced its statement and acknowledged churchill 's alleged ancestry of being cherokee
because mr. churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the ukb in promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an associate membership as an honor , the tribe 's website now said .
however , mr. churchill may possess eligibility status for cherokee nation of oklahoma , since he claims CD CD cherokee .
the tribe 's spokesperson , lisa stopp , stated the tribe enrolls only members with certified CD quarter american indian blood .
the website statement further clarified that churchill was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a certificate of degree of indian blood cdib , and the associate membership did not entitle an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe .
churchill has never asked for cdib certification , and finds the idea of being vetted by the us government offensive .
in june CD , the united keetoowah band had voted to stop awarding associate memberships .
such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with indian ancestry , and it does not entitle an individual to vote in the tribe as a member .
the keetoowah band states that churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded .
in a separate interview , ernestine berry , formerly on the tribe 's enrollment committee and CD years on its council , said that churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe .
in june CD , the rocky mountain news published an article about churchill 's genealogy and family history .
it turned up no evidence of a single indian ancestor among CD direct ancestors of churchill 's identified from records .
the news reported that both churchill 's birth parents were listed as white on the CD census , as were all but CD of his great great grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents .
the news found that some of churchill 's accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records .
numerous members of churchill 's extended family have longstanding family legends of indian ancestry among ancestors .
but , none was confirmed among the CD direct forebears of churchill who were identified .
documents in churchill 's university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a special opportunity position .
in CD , then cu boulder chancellor james corbridge refused to take action on allegations that churchill was fraudulently claiming to be an indian , saying it has always been university policy that a person 's race or ethnicity is self proving .
some of churchill 's native american critics , such as vernon bellecourt white earth ojibwe and suzan shown harjo southern cheyenne muscogee creek , argue that his assertion of native american ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination .
the university has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity .
the university of colorado 's research misconduct committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship .
the committee concluded that the allegation was not appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct .
in a CD interview in the rocky mountain news , churchill said , i have never been confirmed as having CD quarter blood , and never said i was .
and even if the critics are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue
i have never claimed to be goddamned sitting bull .
the longtime indigenous activist russell means said in february of that year , so i want , from this day forward , every media person nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that ward churchill is a full blooded indian leader .
churchill has responded to requests for verification of his claimed indian heritage in various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some native american tribes establish their membership requirements .
churchill argues that the united states instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency .
for decades in his writings , churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose .
he says ,
set the blood quantum at CD quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition of indians , let intermarriage proceed as it has and eventually indians will be defined out of existence .
churchill 's assertions have been raised as CD of the several research misconduct allegations that were brought against him in CD see below .
he has been accused of using his interpretation of the dawes act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member .
churchill has written on american indian history and culture , and speaks about genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the americas by european settlers and what he describes as the repression of native peoples that continues to this day .
as of CD , according to a report submitted on his behalf , churchill has written CD books on his own and co authored CD .
some have been reprinted with updates .
he has written CD book chapters , CD law reviews , and CD scholarly essays .
CD of these were refereed .
he has edited CD volumes and co edited CD more .
according to the university of colorado investigation , his academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation , drawing upon studies by other scholars , not monographs describing new research based on primary sources .
the investigation also noted that he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals , not in the university presses or mainstream peer reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics .
in addition to his academic writing , churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion .
in CD , churchill wrote an essay titled pacifism as pathology notes on an american pseudopraxis criticizing pacifist politics within the you.s. left as being hypocritical , de facto racist and ineffectual .
in CD , arbeiter ring publishing published the essay in a book entitled pacifism as pathology reflections on the role of armed struggle in north america and listing ward churchill as the author .
the book included a preface by ed mead , a new introduction to the essay by churchill and a commentary by mike ryan .
the book sparked much debate in leftist circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti globalization movement in the following few years .
agents of repression CD , co authored by jim vander wall , describes what the authors claim was a secret war against the black panther party and american indian movement carried out during the late 1960s and 70s by the fbi under the cointelpro program .
the cointelpro papers CD .
reissued CD , also co authored with jim vander wall , examines a series of original fbi memos that detail the bureau 's activities against various leftist groups , from the you.s. communist party in the 1950s to activists concerned with central american issues in the 1980s .
in fantasies of the master race CD , churchill examines the portrayal of american indians and the use of american indian symbols in popular american culture .
he focuses on such phenomena as tony hillerman 's mystery novels , the film dances with wolves , and the new age movement , finding examples of cultural imperialism and exploitation .
churchill calls author carlos castaneda 's claims of revealing the teachings of a yaqui indian shaman , the greatest hoax since piltdown man .
struggle for the land CD .
reissued CD is a collection of essays in which churchill chronicles what he describes as the you.s. government 's systematic exploitation of native lands and the killing or displacement of american indians .
he details native american efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent defoliation and industrial practices such as surface mining .
churchill 's indians are us
CD , a sequel to fantasies of the master race , further explores american indian issues in popular culture and politics .
he examines the movie black robe , the pine ridge indian reservation killings , the prosecution of leonard peltier , sports mascots , the indian arts and crafts act of CD , and blood quantum laws , calling them tools of genocide .
churchill is particularly outspoken about new age exploitations of shamanism and american indian sacred traditions , and the do it yourself indianism of certain contemporary authors .
john p. lavelle of the university of new mexico school of law published a review of indians are us
in the american indian quarterly .
professor lavelle , an enrolled member of the santee sioux nation , states that indians are us
twists historical facts and is hostile toward indian tribes .
it was in this book that churchill first made the claim that the united states distributed smallpox infested blankets to indian tribes , a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade .
the claim has been criticized as a falsification .
churchill has , however , received support from some scholars .
from a native son selected essays on indigenism , CD CD CD is a collection of CD previously published essays on native american history , culture , and political activism .
in his introduction to this volume , howard zinn lauds the emergence of a new generation of native american scholars and describes churchill 's writing as powerful , eloquent , unsparing of cannot and deception .
churchill 's a little matter of genocide CD is a survey of ethnic cleansing in the americas from CD to the present .
he compares the treatment of north american indians to historical instances of genocide by the khmer rouge in cambodia , turks against armenians , and europeans against the gypsies , as well as nazis against the poles and jews .
in perversions of justice CD , churchill argues that the you.s. s legal system was adapted to gain control over native american people .
tracing the evolution of federal indian law , churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non indians in the you.s. , but later adapted for application abroad .
he concludes that this demonstrates the development of the you.s. s imperial logic , which depends on a corrupt form of legalism to establish colonial control and empire .
churchill 's controversial essay on CD CD was expanded into a book length manuscript , published as on the justice of roosting chickens reflections on the consequences of you.s. imperial arrogance and criminality CD by ak press .
the book features CD other chapters , CD listing us military interventions , another listing what churchill believes to be us violations of international law .
the original essay takes the roosting chickens of the title from a CD malcolm x speech , in which malcolm x linked the assassination of you.s. president john f. kennedy to the violence which kennedy perpetuated as merely a case of chickens coming home to roost .
churchill 's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by you.s. imperialism of the 20th and 21st centuries .
churchill has been active since at least CD as the co director of the denver based american indian movement of colorado , now an autonomous chapter of the american indian movement .
in CD , he and other local aim leaders , including russell means , glenn t. morris , robert robideau , and david hill , broke with the national aim leadership , including dennis banks and the brothers vernon and clyde bellecourt , claiming that all aim chapters are autonomous .
the aim grand governing council is based in minneapolis and retains the name of the national group .
it says that the schism arose when means , churchill , glenn t. morris and others openly supported the miskito indian group misurasata , who were allied with the anti revolutionary , cia backed contras .
it was a year in which other fbi informants had been discovered in aim .
on november CD , CD , means held a press conference in denver , colorado in which he accused the bellecourt brothers of complicity in aquash 's death , and named CD lower level aim members involved in her death arlo looking cloud , john graham , and theda nelson clark .
this was the first time that an aim leader active at the time of the aquash murder had publicly accused aim of having been involved .
looking cloud and graham were convicted of murder in CD and CD , by federal and south dakota state juries , respectively .
by then clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted .
means attributed the split in aim to divisions in the aftermath of aquash 's murder .
the journalist harlan mckosato said in CD , her aquash 's death has divided the american indian movement
the schism continued , with the national aim leadership claiming that the local aim leaders , such as churchill , are tools of the you.s. government used against other american indians .
specifically , they refer to a CD boulder , colorado interview with jodi rave , a former columnist for the denver post , in which churchill stated that he was teaching the rapid city police department about the american indian movement .
in addition , vernon bellecourt accused churchill of having fraudulently represented himself as an indian to bolster his credentials .
bellecourt said he complained to the university of colorado about this as early as CD .
churchill has been a leader of colorado aim 's annual protests in denver against the columbus day holiday and its associated parade .
colorado aim 's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the denver italian american community , the main supporters of the parade .
as early as CD , churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional , arguing that the ninth amendment to the constitution provides native americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays , overriding the first amendment rights of non native americans .
churchill wrote an essay in september CD entitled on the justice of roosting chickens .
in it , he argued that the september CD attacks were provoked by you.s. foreign policy .
he compared the role of financial workers at the world trade center in ongoing genocidal american imperialism to the role played by adolf eichmann in organizing the holocaust .
in CD , this essay was widely publicized when hamilton college invited churchill to speak .
this led to both condemnations of churchill and counter accusations of mccarthyism by churchill and supporters .
following the controversy , the university of colorado interim chancellor phil distefano said , while professor churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views , his essay on CD CD has outraged and appalled us and the general public .
a documentary called shouting fire stories from the edge of free speech , broadcast on hbo , prominently features churchill 's case in addressing the issues of free speech and first amendment rights .
the controversy attracted increased academic attention to churchill 's research , which had already been criticized by the legal scholar john lavelle and historian guenter lewy .
additional critics were the sociologist thomas brown , who had been preparing an article on churchill 's work , and the historians r.g. robertson and russell thornton , who claimed that churchill had misrepresented their work .
on may CD , CD the university released their findings .
the investigative committee agreed unanimously that churchill had engaged in serious research misconduct , including falsification , fabrication , and CD of the CD allegations of plagiarism .
the committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions .
the standing committee on research misconduct accepted the findings of the investigative committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed .
churchill 's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the university 's privilege and tenure committee , which found that CD of the CD findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offences .
CD members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and CD year 's suspension without pay , while CD favored dismissal .
on july CD , CD , the university regents voted CD to CD to uphold all CD of the findings of research misconduct , overruling the recommendation of privilege and tenure panel that CD be dismissed .
by a vote of CD to CD , the regents determined to fire churchill .
the next day , churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views .
the jury in churchill 's suit for reinstatement weighed the university 's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case .
as stanley fish said , it was the jury s task to determine whether churchill s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements .
the jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to churchill 's firing and rejected the university 's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal .
on april CD , CD , a colorado jury found that churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded CD in damages .
as CD of the jurors said later in a press interview , it was not a slap in his face or anything like that when we did not give him any money .
it is just that churchill 's attorney david lane kept saying this was not about the money , and in the end , we took his word for that .
churchill 's counsel asked chief judge larry j. naves of the denver district court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict .
on july CD , CD , judge naves found that the defendants university were entitled to quasi judicial immunity as a matter of law , vacated the jury verdict and determined that the university did not owe churchill any financial compensation .
naves denied churchill 's request for reinstatement at cu .
churchill appealed both decisions .
on november CD , CD , a CD judge panel of the colorado court of appeals affirmed the trial court 's decision .
in february CD , churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the colorado supreme court .
in late may CD , the colorado supreme court agreed to hear his case .
court records indicate that oral arguments began june CD , CD .
on september CD , CD , the court ruled that the university had quasi judicial immunity , upholding the trial court 's ruling .
on april CD , CD , the you.s. supreme court declined to hear an appeal from churchill .
CD , alfred university awarded him an honorary doctorate of humane letters .

david horowitz vs. ward churchill .
insidehighered.com. retrieved CD CD CD .
churchill 's subjects are often american indian figures and other themes associated with native american culture .

fort scott national historic site is a historical area under the control of the united states national park service in bourbon county , kansas , united states .
named after general winfield scott , who achieved renown during the mexican american war , during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for us army action in what was the edge of settlement in CD .
for the next quarter century , it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the west to settlement , a period which included bleeding kansas and the american civil war .
the current national historic site protects CD historic structures , a parade ground , and CD acres CD CD m of restored tallgrass prairie , inside the city of fort scott .
it is open to visitors most days of the year .
in CD , fort scott was named after winfield scott , was established on the american frontier on the military road in eastern kansas between fort leavenworth and fort gibson .
it was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the eastern united states .
fort scott became CD of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the plains indians , as well as to protect the indians from the settlers encroachment .
the united states government intention to reserve permanent indian lands west of the missouri river gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to encroach on the indian settlements .
fort scott 's most active days were between CD and CD , although it was also used during the civil war .
the cherokee of indian territory now oklahoma were upset to have fort wayne in their proximity .
after some delay , the us army decided to abandon fort wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between fort leavenworth and the site .
the army both wanted to placate the cherokee who were supervised by the department of defense and provide more defense for white settlers and other indians against the osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area .
on april CD , CD , some soldiers of fort wayne left their fort and on april CD arrived where fort scott would be built , in the osage cuestas section of modern day kansas .
after haggling with the cherokees to acquire the land , the rest of fort wayne 's garrison left the fort on may CD and arrived at the fort scott site on may CD .
unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built .
the wide open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary .
the soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment .
these buildings were on the edges of a CD foot CD m parade ground .
the post quartermaster , captain thomas swords , was in charge of building fort scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the kansas prairie , which had few trees .
he had only CD bricklayers and CD carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform .
wood was available , but the mill was built CD CD miles CD CD km away , making transport time consuming .
swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment .
freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort 's construction .
as a result , only CD duplex of the CD planned officers quarters CD duplexes and post commandant 's house was built by CD , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed .
in his CD inspection of the fort , colonel george croghan reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered fort scott above average .
due to the rising tensions that escalated in the mexican american war , the us army redeployed troops to the southwest .
with fort scott still uncompleted , officials decided on april CD , CD , that no more construction would be done there , after CD years and CD CD .
by the time it was finished , it was obsolete .
CD years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western fort riley .
for the average soldier , life at the fort was monotonous .

aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort .
officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including captain swords .
CD miles east in missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts martial followed soldiers going awol at the shop .
the desertion rate from the fort ranged from CD CD , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life .
as no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base .
hunting was a popular pastime .
according to captain swords , wolf chasing and duck hunting was the only way CD officer could tolerate the place .
CD years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with CD being converted to hotels .
in CD the kansas nebraska act repealed the missouri compromise of CD , which had kept slavery out of kansas .
missourians in favor of slavery soon moved to kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not kansas would permit slavery .
settlers from new england arrived equally determined to keep it out .
each of the CD competing factions of the bleeding kansas conflict claimed CD of the hotels at fort scott free soil at the fort scott hotel and pro slavery at the western hotel .
most of the residents in fort scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free soil side .
during this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting .
during the american civil war , the fort was renewed as a us military post .
in august CD , the union army took command of fort scott , and readied it for the war times .
the united states army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions .
the union army rented the properties from the current civilian owners .
troops from indiana , iowa , colorado , ohio , and wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to subjugate missouri , arkansas , or the indian territory .
fort scott was CD of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the united states colored troops of the union army .
a major supply depot was situated at the fort .
confederate general sterling price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the confederate force came to the garrison was CD miles CD km away at battle of dry wood creek .
the site was strategically important as it was within a southern sympathizing area and close to the confederate state of arkansas and the unstable indian territory present day state of oklahoma , where many of the members of the CD civilized tribes were allied with the confederates .
the fort served as a general hospital large military hospital and prison until after the war .
following the end of the war , in october CD the us army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled .
on january CD , CD , the army returned with the formation of the post of southeast kansas .
the post was based at fort scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort .
they were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers .
some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the us government in rights of way , would evict them from their squatter homes .
the settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads , and lumped both as enemies .
settlers also had some continuing conflicts with indians and insurgents using the recent confederate because as excuse for robbery .
by the spring of CD , the us army withdrew the troops from fort scott for good .
from CD to CD , the buildings of the fort were left unattended , and slowly deteriorated .
many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use .
with the act of august CD , CD , the national park service gave the city government of fort scott , kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort .
on october CD , CD , fort scott became a national historic site under the supervision of the national park service , encompassing CD acres CD CD m2 .

the previous ppv event sacrifice and tna 's next ppv event victory road both received a CD out of CD by chris sokol and bob kapur , respectively .
compared to rival world wrestling entertainment 's wwe CD night stand ppv event on june CD , both performed equally , as CD night stand received the same rating from matt mackinder .
waldman felt that tna put on a strong ppv that was in large part to little gimmickery .
regarding the main event , waldman gave it a CD out of CD , while the world tag team championship match received a CD out of CD .
he gave the CD woman tag team match a CD CD out of CD and the a.j. styles versus kurt angle bout a CD out of CD .
the x division championship contest was given a CD out of CD .
wade keller of the pro wrestling torch newsletter reviewed the show .
he felt the main event had lots of action and drama , but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner than beating someone to win a fight .
keller said the world tag team championship contest was a solid tag match with some elaborate sequences that were well executed .
keller stated that the x division championship match was a very good opener .
regarding the styles and angle bout , keller commented that it was a good match , but short of a classic must see match in part because there were too many chinlocks mid match from angle that took the crowd out of it .
james caldwell , also of the pro wrestling torch newsletter , posted a review of the show in which he felt the main event was a slow , plodding match with an anticlimactic finish .
caldwell stated that the styles versus angle contest was a fine spotlight singles match , but was a bit underwhelming when the expectations were reasonably high for CD of tna 's best wrestlers in a featured singles match .
he went on to say that he felt it was missing something and that it seemed like the match just never moved out of second gear .
caldwell felt the x division championship bout was a very good opening match , which could have been a featured match to sell a few additional ppv buys , but tna did not give the x division any focus until the final show before the ppv .
caldwell stated the world tag team championship was just a slow , plodding tag match .
regarding the marriage segment during the show , caldwell said it was just a bad , bad , bad segment that died slowly and painfully in front of the live audience .
overall , caldwell felt that tna showcased the x division in the opening match , but needed more athleticism on the show to balance the slow , plodding former wwe heavyweight wrestlers in the main event slots .

king of the mountain match
home made mince pie is a CD american silent short comedy produced by the thanhouser company .
the film is a comedy of circumstances , in which the gale family is going to host a dinner .
the focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more appreciable , but CD people each add brandy to the pie .
everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie , including the family cat , and the film concludes .
no cast or staff credits for this film are known .
the film was released on september CD , CD , to mixed reviews in trade publications .
reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that CD pie split CD ways would be able to impact everyone .
the film is presumed lost .
though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in the moving picture world from september CD , CD .
it states life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome , and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed .
so the time honored get togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar .
they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay .
the gales thought well of this established feature .
they made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests .
on the night before such an event neither mamma , pappa , or daughter gale could get those minutes solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests comfort .
at the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape .
so little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie the gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie .
first mamma gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir .
then pappa gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir .
finally daughter gale would have to come over and honor it likewise .
then arrived the guests .
the minister and the mrs. minister , they were , and some neighbors .
while she was receiving them the recollection came to mamma gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring .
off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen .
she pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests .
then pappa gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored .
he , too , excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince .
no sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than daughter gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring , rushes in and makes for the whiskey .
she pours the right proportion in , too .
the writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely lloyd lonergan .
he was an experienced newspaperman employed by the new york evening world while writing scripts for the thanhouser productions .
the film director is unknown , but it may have been barry o'neil .
film historian q. david bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least CD possible candidates exist .
blair smith was the first cameraman of the thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by carl louis gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer .
the role of the cameraman was uncredited in CD productions .
the cast credits are unknown , but many CD thanhouser productions are fragmentary .
in late CD , the thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films .
the list includes g.w. abbe , justus d. barnes , frank h. crane , irene crane , marie eline , violet heming , martin j. faust , thomas fortune , george middleton , grace moore , john w. noble , anna rosemond , mrs. george walters .
a surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying CD actors .
the single reel comedy , approximately CD CD feet long , was released on september CD , CD .
the film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements in theaters known in indiana , kansas , wisconsin , and pennsylvania .
the film would also be shown in vancouver , canada and was met with praise by the audience at the province theatre .
in CD , years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the pennsylvania state board of censors of moving pictures .
the the moving picture world reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault .
the reviewer states , a domestic comedy with a different flavor .
the humor in this piece centers around this pie .
what happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination .
imagine CD people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in CD mince pie
we do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week .
licensed as well as independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters .
the mince pie episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone .
walton of the moving picture news was not amused by the plot and stated , to me the last scene had no humor .
it was only the necessary ending to the beginning .
true humor does not emanate from cognac .
the new york dramatic mirror stated , this is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way .
the early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation .
a weak point in the story is the fact that the pie is cut into CD small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power .
CD pies would have been as easy to make as CD and would have been more convincing .
the character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera .
back off boogaloo is a song by english musician ringo starr , released as a non album single in march CD .
starr 's former beatles bandmate george harrison produced the recording , which took place in london shortly after the CD had appeared together at harrison 's concert for bangladesh shows in august CD .
the single was a follow up to starr 's CD hit song it do not come easy and continued his successful run as a solo artist .
back off boogaloo peaked at number CD in britain and canada , and number CD on america 's billboard hot CD .
it remains starr 's highest charting single in the united kingdom .
the title for the song was inspired by english singer songwriter marc bolan .
some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at paul mccartney , reflecting starr 's disdain for the music mccartney had made as a solo artist over the previous CD years .
back off boogaloo demonstrates the influence of glam rock on starr , who directed a documentary film , born to boogie CD , about bolan 's band t. rex around this time .
described by CD author as a high energy in your face rocker , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by harrison and contributions from musicians gary wright and klaus voormann .
starr re recorded back off boogaloo for his CD album stop and smell the roses , in a collaboration with american singer harry nilsson that incorporates lyrics from beatles songs such as with a little help from my friends , good day sunshine and baby , you are a rich man .
the original version has appeared on starr 's compilation albums blast from your past and photograph the very best of ringo starr , and as a bonus track on his remastered CD studio album goodnight vienna .
since his return to touring in CD , starr has performed back off boogaloo regularly in concert with the various incarnations of his all starr band .
ringo starr identified his initial inspiration for back off boogaloo as having come from marc bolan , the singer and guitarist with english glam rock band t. rex .
in a CD interview with mojo editor paul du noyer , starr described bolan as a dear friend who used to come into the office when i was running apple movies , a big office in town , and the hang out for myself , harry nilsson and keith moon .
over dinner CD evening at starr 's home outside london , bolan had used the word boogaloo so often that it stuck in starr 's mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight .
when discussing the composition on vh1 storytellers in may CD , starr explained bolan was an energised guy .
he used to speak back off boogaloo ooh you , boogaloo .
do you want some potatoes
ooh you , boogaloo
starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children 's toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song .
the lyrics to the middle CD of back off boogaloo came to starr while watching london weekend television 's football show , the big match .
the program 's host , jimmy hill , often referred to a footballer 's playing as tasty , a catchphrase that starr incorporated into his song lyrics
get yourself together now
and give me something tasty
everything you try to do
you know it sure sounds wasted .
commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by starr on his former beatles bandmate paul mccartney .
starr has denied any such interpretation , instead claiming that the song was inspired by bolan and nothing more , beatles biographer robert rodriguez writes .
starr had publicly criticised mccartney 's solo albums mccartney CD and ram CD on release , and author bruce spizer paraphrases the message of the middle CD as a plea for paul to produce better music .
the mention of sound ing wasted could also be a reference to mccartney 's overindulgence with cannabis , rodriguez suggests .
a further example of starr 's allegedly anti mccartney message exists in the song 's first verse
wake up , meathead
do not pretend that you are dead
get yourself up off the cart .
the same commentators suggest that here starr could be referring to the CD paul is dead hoax .
the latter rumour circulated during september and october of that year while mccartney hid away on his scottish farm , disconsolate after john lennon had told him and starr that he wanted a divorce from the beatles .
author keith badman writes that boogaloo had long been cited as paul 's nickname from his former bandmates starr , lennon and george harrison .
when tailoring his CD composition i am the greatest for starr to record on the album ringo CD , lennon referenced the song title with the lines now i am only CD CD and all i want to do is boogaloo .
although t rex devotees , in the words of starr biographer alan clayson , claimed that bolan had ghost written back off boogaloo , starr later acknowledged that harrison co wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody .
as on starr 's CD hit single it do not come easy , harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution .
starr originally offered back off boogaloo to fellow liverpudlian cilla black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new starr harrison composition , photograph .
having earmarked the song as his next single , starr recorded back off boogaloo in september CD , following his appearance at the harrison organised concert for bangladesh in new york .
the sessions took place at apple studio in central london , with harrison producing , as he had on it do not come easy .
the recording reflects the influence of glam rock on starr through what authors chip madinger and mark easter term its big drum sound and repetitious nature , with a line up comprising starr vocals , drums , percussion , harrison guitars , gary wright piano and klaus voormann bass , saxophone .
rodriguez describes starr 's martial sounding opening as a rare showcase for his own drumming , while harrison biographer simon leng writes of a roaring series of harrison slide breaks that brought to mind duane allman .
further overdubs included contributions from CD backing vocalists , led by american soul singer madeline bell .
for the single 's b side , starr had already written and recorded blindman , the theme song for the ferdinando baldi directed spaghetti western of the same name , filming for which starr had interrupted in order to perform at the concert for bangladesh .
starr produced the track with voormann .
the sessions for blindman took place at apple on CD CD august , with badfinger guitarist pete ham assisting starr and voormann .
like the film blindman CD , the song is held in low regard by critics .
spizer describes it as a muddy sounding dirge with little to recommend .
apple records issued the single on CD march CD in britain , as apple r CD , with a us release taking place CD days later , as apple CD .
it was starr 's first release since it do not come easy , a year before .
during this period , his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as CD motels CD and blindman .
further aligning himself with britain 's glam rock movement , starr made his directorial debut with born to boogie CD , a film starring bolan that included starr 's footage of a t. rex concert held at wembley on CD march .
the song was a hit in the us , reaching number CD on the billboard hot CD , and achieved starr 's best position on the uk singles chart , where it reached number CD .
a promotional video for back off boogaloo was shot on CD march at lennon 's tittenhurst park residence while starr was looking after the property .
the video , which shows starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a frankenstein like monster , was directed by tom taylor and financed by caravel films .
a similar monster appeared on the single 's picture sleeve , holding a cigarette .
alan clayson writes of reviewers criticising back off boogaloo for being repetitious , leading starr to respond in a CD interview play me a pop song that is not .
on release , chris welch wrote in melody maker a number CD hit could easily be in store for the maestro of rock drums .
there is a touch of the marc bolans in this highly playable rhythmic excursion it is hypnotic and effective , ideal for jukeboxes and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week .
woffinden described the single as every bit as ebullient as it do not come easy , although slightly inferior , while mike degagne of allmusic views it as a song where t he jovial spirit of ringo starr shines through .
in a CD article for the nme , charles shaar murray highlighted back off boogaloo as a great radio and juke box tune .
among beatle biographers , simon leng terms it a rocking , soccer crowd chant that suited starr 's talents well , and bruce spizer praises the track as a high energy in your face rocker propelled by ringo 's thundering drums and george 's stinging slide guitar .
in the CD publication nme originals beatles the solo years CD CD , paul moody listed back off boogaloo first among starr 's CD solo gems and described it as good time rock'n'droll to match the faces .
re releases for back off boogaloo include starr 's CD greatest hits album , blast from your past , and , along with blindman , as a bonus track on the CD reissue of his goodnight vienna album CD .
back off boogaloo also appeared on his CD compilation photograph the very best of ringo starr , the collector 's edition of which included his CD video for the song .
starr recorded a new version of back off boogaloo for his CD album on boardwalk records , stop and smell the roses .
the song was produced by starr 's friend , singer harry nilsson , and features a musical arrangement by van dyke parks .
similar to nilsson 's CD cover of the beatles you cannot do that , the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band 's songs in this case , with a little help from my friends , help
, lady madonna , good day sunshine and baby , you are a rich man , as well as starr 's it do not come easy .
in a further reference to his past , the CD version of back off boogaloo opens with the same guitar riff that harrison had played on it do not come easy CD years before .
starr taped the basic track at evergreen recording studios in los angeles on CD november CD , with additional recording taking place on CD CD december at nassau 's compass point studios .
among the large cast of musicians supporting starr were nilsson vocals , jim keltner drums , jane getz piano , dennis budimir and richie zito guitars , and a CD piece horn section led by saxophonist jerry jumonville .
starr overdubbed his vocals on CD december , CD days before the murder of john lennon , who had been due to record his contributions to stop and smell the roses in january CD .
contrasting with his success as a solo artist in CD CD , the album continued starr 's run of commercial and critical failures since CD .
rodriguez writes that m ost people either love or hate the revamping of back off boogaloo .
starr has performed back off boogaloo in concert with his all starr band , beginning with the band 's debut tour of north america in july september CD .
the song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour , however , in favour of the CD lennon mccartney composition i want to be your man .
live versions of back off boogaloo have appeared on the multi disc compilation the anthology so far CD and king biscuit flower hour presents ringo his new all starr band CD .

where the streets have no name is a song by irish rock band u2 .
it is the opening track from their CD album the joshua tree and was released as the album 's third single in august CD .
the song 's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end .
lead vocalist bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in belfast .
during the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer brian eno considered erasing the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch .
where the streets have no name was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number CD in the us , number CD in canada , number CD in the netherlands , and number CD in the united kingdom .
the song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in CD on the joshua tree tour .
the song was performed on a los angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video , which won a grammy award for best performance music video .
the music for where the streets have no name originated from a demo that guitarist the edge composed the night before the group resumed the joshua tree sessions .
in an upstairs room at melbeach house his newly purchased home the edge used a CD track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine .
realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs , the edge wanted to conjure up the ultimate u2 live song , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future u2 show if he were a fan .
after finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with the most amazing guitar part and song of his life .
with no one in the house to share the demo with , the edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration .
although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song .
bassist adam clayton said , at the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works .
the arrangement , with CD time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was rehearsed many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked .
according to co producer daniel lanois , that was the science project song .
i remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard , as we call them .
i was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd .
it was ridiculous .
co producer brian eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of where the streets have no name .
the band worked on a single take for weeks , but as eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up .
through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance .
so much time had been spent on screwdriver work that eno thought it would be best to start from scratch .
his idea was to stage an accident and have the song 's tapes erased .
he said that this was not to force abandonment of the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance .
at CD point , eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over , but this erasure never took place .
according to engineer flood , fellow engineer pat mccarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained eno .
the studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes .
it was CD of several songs mixed by steve lillywhite in the final months of recording the joshua tree .
drummer larry mullen , jr. later said of the song , it took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it .
it only became a truly great song through playing live .
on the record , musically , it is not half the song it is live .
where the streets have no name is played at a tempo of CD beats per minute .
the introduction and outro are played in a CD CD time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common CD CD signature .
the songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with chorale like sustained synthesiser notes .
the guitar fades in after CD seconds .
this part consists of a repeated chiming CD note arpeggio .
a dotted eighth delay effect is used to play each note in the arpeggio twice , thus creating a rich sound .
the bass and drums enter at CD CD .
the introduction , following a i iv i iv vi v i chord progression , creates a wall of sound , as described by mark butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly CD minutes .
the guitar part played for the remainder of the song features the edge strumming percussive sixteenth notes .
the bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while bono 's vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its timbre , he sighs .
he moans .
he grunts .
he exhales audibly .
he allows his voice to crack as well as timing by his usage of rubato to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat .
this development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line burning down love a g f d .
the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the a4 at burning .
in later choruses , bono sings blown by the wind with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer .
after the third chorus , the song 's outro is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a CD note guitar arpeggio played against sustained synthesiser notes .
the lyrics were inspired by a story that bono heard about the streets of belfast , northern ireland , where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live on .
he contrasted this with the anonymity he felt when visiting ethiopia , saying the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there are not such divisions , a place where the streets have no name .
to me , that is the way a great rock n roll concert should be a place where everyone comes together maybe that is the dream of all art to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all .
bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to ethiopia with his wife , ali hewson .
he first wrote them down on an airsickness bag while staying in a village .
according to him , the song is ostensibly about transcendence , elevation , whatever you want to call it .
i was trying to sketch a feeling .
the open ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations .
journalist michael campbell believed the lyrics send a message of hope and wish for a world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion .
with regard to the place bono was referring to in the song , he said , i am not sure , really , about that .
i used to think it was belfast journalist niall stokes believes the title was influenced by bono 's and his wife ali 's visit to ethiopia as volunteer aid workers .
bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open ended lyrics i can look at it now and recognize that the song has CD of the most banal couplets in the history of pop music .
but it also contains some of the biggest ideas .
in a curious way , that seems to work .
if you get any way heavy about these things , you do not communicate .
but if you are flip or throwaway about it , then you do .
that is CD of the paradoxes i have come to terms with .
originally , the third single from the joshua tree was meant to be the song red hill mining town , but where the streets have no name was released instead , in august CD .
the single was released on CD inch , CD inch , cassette and cd single formats .
CD b sides were featured on the single , including race against time , silver and gold , and sweetest thing , except for the CD inch release , which only featured the latter CD tracks .
the CD inch single featured race against time on side a of the record despite being a b side , and the cassette single featured all CD tracks on both sides of the tape .
although not as successful as the album 's first CD singles , the song did chart well .
in the you.s. , the song peaked at number CD on the billboard hot CD and number CD on the album rock tracks charts .
the song reached number CD on the uk singles chart , and it topped the irish singles chart .
the video begins with an aerial shot of a block in los angeles , and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc jockeys stating that u2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of CD CD people .
police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance .
CD minutes into the video , u2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th ave. and s. main st. , and perform where the streets have no name to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building .
towards the end of the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police .
the video for where the streets have no name was directed by meiert avis and produced by michael hamlyn and ben dossett .
the band attracted over CD CD people during the video 's filming , which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in downtown los angeles on CD march CD .
the band 's performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the beatles final concert , as depicted in the film let it be .
during the shoot u2 played an CD song set , which included CD performances of where the streets have no name .
prior to filming , a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans .
a backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator , which happened during filming .
the depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video .
hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police .
according to avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day almost in real time , and that getting busted was an integral part of the plan .
band manager paul mcguinness revealed in CD that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated .
the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video .
in the background of the video is a sign for the million dollar hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the film shoot .
although the video is of a live performance , the audio used is from the studio recorded version of the song .
the video won the grammy award for best performance music video at the CD grammy awards .
race against time was released on the CD inch , cassette , and cd versions of the single .
the song developed from the band 's interest in urban funk , and was described by the edge as a kind of afro rhythmic piece and a study in rhythm .
the bass riff in the song , inspired by the bodhrán , was played by the edge , but stemmed from some of clayton 's unused bass parts .
mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single take .
the song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by bono 's trip to ethiopia after live aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence .
these lyrical references include bono singing in an ethiopian language and following it with the phrase race against time .
bono said of the song , it reminds me of the desert .
the desert is so empty , but it aches with a strange kind of fullness .
john hutchinson of musician magazine described the song as having an african flavour and as being reminiscent of peter gabriel .
the track was used in the miami vice episode child 's play , and is the only CD of the single 's b sides that was never played live .
silver and gold was written in support of the artists united against apartheid project , which protested the south african apartheid .
in CD , bono participated in steven van zandt 's anti apartheid sun city project and spent time with keith richards and mick jagger of the rolling stones .
when richards and jagger played blues , bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of u2 's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid 1970s .
bono realised that u2 had no tradition , and he felt as if they were from outer space .
this inspired him to write the blues influenced song silver and gold , which he recorded with richards and ronnie wood .
it was re recorded by u2 for the where the streets have no name single while the band returned to dublin during in may CD during a break between the first and second legs of the joshua tree tour .
the song was described by musician as tough and raw , with bono in husky and confident voice , underpinned by a sinuous bass line , and with the edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues based guitar .
silver and gold was played live on the joshua tree tour several times , CD performance of which was featured on the band 's CD album and rockumentary , rattle and hum .
both the studio recording and the sun city versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of the joshua tree .
the studio version was also included on the limited edition b sides bonus disk of the band 's first compilation album , the best of CD CD .
sweetest thing was written by bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday .
the song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play .
some of bono 's lyrics have been described as reminiscent of john lennon .
the edge described it as a beautiful song which is pop as it should be not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity , also noting that it is very new for us .
it was re recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in CD as a single in its own right for the best of CD CD .
hot press editor niall stokes stated that this track , along with race against time , is an indicator of what u2 might have made instead of the joshua tree .
upon the release of the joshua tree , critics praised where the streets have no name .
not preachers who claim to have found answers .
the bergen record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest .
rolling stone called it assertive rock in their review of the joshua tree .
the san diego union tribune said of where the streets have no name , the music charges , like someone fleeing for life .
the washington post said the track is a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in bono 's resolute delivery , dave the edge evan 's quavering guitar , adam clayton 's cathedral bass and larry mullen 's rolling thunder drums .
nme lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album starts by spitting furiously .
the publication praised bono 's impassioned singing and the edge 's guitar playing , which transformed the instrument into something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood .
the review commented that the last CD seconds are breathtakingly beautiful .
the rocket wrote that the song builds a wall of sound that bono 's vocals cut through with a wail of desperation , as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality .
the reviewer compared the opening riff to simple minds ghostdancing .
reviewing the joshua tree , stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic called the song an epic opener .
the service 's steve huey , in a review of the song , praised its insistent , propulsive rhythmic drive and anthemic chorus , qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite .
he called the song the perfect album opener , crediting the slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak .
huey also called bono 's delivery passionate and grandiose and his commitment to the material unshakable .
he believed the combination of his vocals and the band 's sonic power is what gave u2 its tremendous force .
where the streets have no name made its concert debut on CD april CD in tempe , arizona on the opening night of the joshua tree tour .
it has since been played at nearly every full length concert that u2 has headlined , totaling over CD performances as of CD .
the song is widely regarded as CD of the group 's most popular live songs .
bono said of it , we can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes .
the audience is on its feet , singing along with every word .
it is like god suddenly walks through the room .
on the joshua tree tour , where the streets have no name was most often used to open concerts .
fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting .
the san diego union tribune wrote that , from the lofty sonic opening strains of the song , this audience was up , ecstatic and inflamed .
nme wrote that the song is CD such occasion where the power afforded their songs is scary , noting that during the song 's opening , the arena erupts .
in other reviews , the song was called uplifting , exhilarating , and powerful .
out of the CD shows during the joshua tree tour , streets was played at all except CD of the concerts .
during the lovetown tour which took place in CD and the beginning of CD , streets was only left out of the set list at CD of the CD concerts .
the song was performed at every show on the CD CD zoo tv tour .
concerts from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including where the streets have no name , straight .
some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from the joshua tree 's photo shoot .
the video was speeded up for humorous effect nme described the effect as giving it a silly , charlie chaplin quality and bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens .
this video would make a return during performances on the CD and CD legs of the u2 CD tour .
some of the zoo tv performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the pet shop boys synthpop cover of the song titled where the streets have no name i cannot take my eyes off you .
bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the pet shop boys cover .
critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist the independent said the song induces instant euphoria , as u2 do what they are best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena .
in CD other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits .
for the popmart tour of CD CD , u2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the zoo tv tour .
the set 's massive video screen displayed a video that hot press described as an astonishing , CD style trip into the heart of a swirling , psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal monolith .
near the end of the song , peace doves were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set 's golden arch were projected upwards .
hot press said the effect transformed the stadium into a ufo landing site .
the experience was CD inspiration for the song city of blinding lights .
the band paid tribute to the CD CD victims during their performance of the song at the super bowl xxxvi halftime show on CD february CD .
the performance featured the names of the september CD victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band .
u2 's appearance was later ranked number CD on sports illustrated 's list of top CD super bowl halftime shows .
for the vertigo tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their setlists , but mullen and clayton successfully argued against this .
all CD of the vertigo tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage 's led video curtains displaying african flags .
on the tour 's opening night , this reminded bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an ethiopian village .
he thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle , saying , and here it was , nearly CD years later , coming back to africa , all the stuff about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time .
the song was also played at the preview screening of the band 's concert film u2 3d at the CD cannes film festival .
at the glastonbury festival CD , the edge accompanied rock band muse for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with u2 while headlining glastonbury in CD .
u2 live from mexico city .
a second version from the popmart tour was featured on please popheart live ep , and later on the you.s. please single .
a live recording from boston during the elevation tour was featured in the concert film elevation CD live from boston , and on the walk on and electrical storm singles .
the CD digital album , live from the point depot , contains a performance from the lovetown tour , only available as part of the complete u2 digital box set .
in CD , q magazine named where the streets have no name the 16th most exciting tune ever .
the following year , q ranked the song at number CD in a special edition titled CD best songs ever .
CD years later , the magazine 's readers voted the track the 43rd greatest song in history .
rolling stone ranked the song at number CD on its list of the CD greatest guitar songs of all time .
in a CD poll by fan site u2 , approximately CD of CD CD respondents named where the streets have no name as their favourite song from the joshua tree , ranking it as the most popular song from the album .
in CD , american sports network espn used the track , among other u2 songs , in commercials for the CD fifa world cup , with the south african soweto gospel choir adding vocals to the song .
the advertisement , titled robben island , portrays south african political prisoners during the apartheid era forming a soccer team .
there are plans to bring a recording of the soweto supported performance to retail .
composer john mackey used the introductory guitar theme in his CD piece for wind ensemble , aurora awakes .
the song 's introduction was used by the vancouver canucks hockey team at the start each of their home games , when the players take to the ice .
the baltimore ravens also use the song as they enter m t bank stadium before home games .
the marquette golden eagles men 's basketball team uses this song in their entrance video before all home games at the bmo harris bradley center .
the song is also used by the wisconsin badgers football team for their entrance video at camp randall stadium prior to all home games .
the kansas jayhawks men 's basketball team uses the song during their starting lineups at allen fieldhouse .
the nazarov cyclization reaction often referred to as simply the nazarov cyclization is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones .
the reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed .
it was originally discovered by ivan nikolaevich nazarov CD CD in CD while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones .
as originally described , the nazarov cyclization involves the activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric lewis acid or protic acid promoter .
the key step of the reaction mechanism involves a cationic CD electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product see mechanism below .
as the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than lewis acids have been subsumed under the name nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway .
the success of the nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products including jasmone , the aflatoxins , and a subclass of prostaglandins and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis .
the reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published .
the mechanism of the classical nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below .
activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation which undergoes a thermally allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the woodward hoffman rules .
this generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a hydrogen .
subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product .
as noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known .
what designates a nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation .
in order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s trans s trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation .
the propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain .
coordination of an electron donating substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation .
similarly , substitution directed inward restricts the s trans conformation so severely that e z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration .
in this way , the nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction , whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific .
the example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs .
see interrupted cyclizations below
along this same vein , allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by marcus tius of the university of hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of hydrogens , obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s cis conformer .
though cyclizations following the general template above had been observed prior to nazarov 's involvement , it was his study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process .
nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product .
the reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone .
research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid 1980s when several syntheses employing the nazarov cyclization were published .
shown below are key steps in the syntheses of trichodiene and nor sterepolide , the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone .
the classical version of the nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent .
the first CD are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization .
the last CD stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate .
strong lewis or protic acids are typically required for the reaction e.g. CD , bf3 , meso3h .
these promoters are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope .
despite the mechanistic possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction .
this limits the atom economy of the reaction .
the elimination step is not regioselective .
if multiple hydrogens are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures .
this is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as arduous separation is typically required .
elimination destroys a potential stereocenter , decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction .
protonation of the enolate is sometimes not stereoselective , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of epimers .
the shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form .
however , modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research .
in particular , the research has focused on a few key areas rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance , directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step , and improving the overall stereoselectivity .
these have been successful to varying degrees .
additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation intercepted in various ways .
furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed .
the sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field .
key examples are given below .
the earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the nazarov cyclization took advantage of the silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step .
this chemistry was developed most extensively by professor scott denmark of the university of illinois , urbana champaign in the mid 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction .
with bicyclic products , the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees .
the silicon directed nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product silphinene , shown below .
the cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety , so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether .
drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , professor alison frontier of the university of rochester developed a paradigm for polarized nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction .
creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination .
in addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the proton , allowing selective formation of the trans epimer via equilibration .
it is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction yield , reaction time , etc .
is typically lower .
by extension , any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a nazarov cyclization .
there have been a large number of examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements .
CD such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes .
the silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride .
in the total synthesis of rocaglamide , epoxidation of a vinyl alkoxyallenyl stannane likewise generates a pentadienyl cation via ring opening of the resultant epoxide .
once the cyclization has occurred , an oxyallyl cation is formed .
as discussed extensively above , the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization .
however , these CD steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles , respectively .
oxyallyl cation trapping has been developed extensively by fredrick g. west of the university of alberta and his review covers the field .
the oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners .
shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in CD step with complete diastereoselectivity .
enolate trapping with various electrophiles is decidedly less common .
in CD study , the nazarov cyclization is paired with a michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to nitrostyrene .
the development of an enantioselective nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of nazarov cyclization reactions .
to that end , several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts .
diastereoselective cyclizations are also known , in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization .
almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity .
selecting CD direction for the vinyl groups to rotate in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below .
silicon directed nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way .
in the example below , the silyl group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating towards it via unfavorable steric interaction .
in this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary .
the starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization .
tius 's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used .
the example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in CD yield and CD enantiomeric excess .
tius has additionally developed a camphor based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin .
the key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro CD propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent .
the first chiral lewis acid promoted asymmetric nazarov cyclization was reported by varinder aggarwal and utilized copper ii bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to CD ee .
the enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of CD mol of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased .
extensions of the nazarov cyclization are generally also subsumed under the same name .
for example , an , unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso nazarov cyclization reaction .
other such extensions have been given similar names , including homo nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous nazarov cyclizations .
because they overstabilize the pentadienyl cation , electron donating substiuents often severely impede nazarov cyclization .
building from this , several electrocyclic ring openings of alkoxy cyclopentanes have been reported .
these are typically referred to as retro nazarov cyclization reactions .
nitrogen analogues of the nazarov cyclization reaction known as imino nazarov cyclization reactions have few instances .
there is CD example of a generalized imino nazarov cyclization reported shown below , and several iso imino nazarov reactions in the literature .
even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity , poor yields , or narrow scope .
the difficulty stems from the relative over stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation , impeding cyclization .
horrible bosses is a CD american black comedy film directed by seth gordon , written by michael markowitz , john francis daley and jonathan goldstein , based on a story by markowitz .
it stars jason bateman , charlie day , jason sudeikis , jennifer aniston , colin farrell , kevin spacey , and jamie foxx .

markowitz 's script was bought by new line cinema in CD and the film spent CD years in various states of pre production , with a variety of actors attached to different roles .
by CD , goldstein and daley had rewritten the script , and the film finally went into production .
the film premiered in los angeles on june CD , CD , and received a wide release on july CD , CD .
the film grossed over CD CD worldwide during its theatrical run .
the film opened to positive critical reception , with several critics praising the ensemble cast , with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews .
the plot received a more mixed response .
some reviewers felt that its dark , humorous premise was explored well , while others felt the jokes were racist , homophobic , and misogynistic .
a sequel , horrible bosses CD , was released on november CD , CD .
nick hendricks bateman and dale arbus day are friends who despise their bosses .
nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic david harken spacey , who implies the possibility of a promotion for nick for months , only to award it to himself .
dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss , dr. julia harris aniston .
she threatens to tell his fiancee stacy lindsay sloane that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her .
at night , over drinks , kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around .
initially hesitant , they eventually agree to kill their employers .
in search of a hitman , the trio meet dean motherfuckah jones foxx , an ex con who agrees to be their murder consultant .
jones suggests that dale , kurt and nick kill each other 's bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents .
the CD reconnoiter bobby 's house , and kurt steals bobby 's phone .
they next go to harken 's house , where kurt and nick go inside while dale waits in the car .
harken returns home and confronts dale for littering , but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter .
dale saves harken by stabbing him with an epipen .
nick and kurt think dale is stabbing harken to death and flee , with kurt accidentally dropping bobby 's phone in harken 's bedroom .
the next night , kurt watches julia 's home , but she seduces and has sex with him .
nick and dale reluctantly wait outside bobby 's and harken 's houses , respectively , to commit the murders , despite neither of them wanting to .
harken discovers bobby 's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address , suspecting his wife rhonda julie bowen is having an affair .
he drives over and kills bobby , with nick as a secret witness .
nick flees at high speed , setting off a traffic camera .
the trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan .
they are arrested by the police , who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in bobby 's murder .
lacking evidence , the police are forced to let the trio go free .
the trio consult with jones again , but learn that he never actually killed anyone , having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film snow falling on cedars .
jones suggests that they get harken to confess and secretly tape it .
the CD accidentally crash harken 's surprise birthday party , where nick and dale get harken to confess to the murder before realizing that kurt , who has the audio recorder , is elsewhere having sex with rhonda .
harken threatens to kill all CD for attempting to blackmail him .
they flee by car , but harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle .
believing they have committed a crime , the car 's navigation system operator remotely disables kurt 's car , allowing harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint .
harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness .
the police arrest nick , dale and kurt , but the navigation system operator , gregory , reveals that it is his companies policy to record all conversations for quality assurance .
gregory plays the tape that has harken confessing he murdered pellitt .
harken is sentenced to CD years to life in prison , while the friends get their charges waived .
nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic ceo , kurt retains his job under a new boss , and dale blackmails julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient , while jones secretly records the act .
jason bateman as nick hendricks
an executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through hoops in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him .
markowitz wrote the role specifically for bateman .
charlie day as dale arbus
a dental assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss .
described as a hopeless romantic in love with his fiancée .
ashton kutcher was in talks for the role at CD different points in the lengthy production .
day was considered for the role following his co starring performance with sudeikis in the CD film going the distance reuters reported that industry insiders believed his performance overshadowed the main stars .
jason sudeikis as kurt buckman
an account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new , drug addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies .
sudeikis was cast in may CD .
jennifer aniston as dr. julia harris , d.d.s.
markowitz based the character on a former boss , claiming she was very sexually aggressive with everybody .
when writing the script , markowitz intended for the role to go to aniston .
he stated , but the aforementioned boss looked more like cruella de vil .
it was like flirting with a cobweb .
so i decided for the sake of the movie , let s go with jennifer aniston .
the actress insisted on wearing a brown wig for the role , wanting to look different from other characters she had played .
colin farrell as bobby pellitt
described as a weaselly scion and a corrupt and incompetent jerk who is in charge of things but clearly has no idea what he is doing .
farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character , stating this guy thinks he is god 's gift to women , god 's gift to intellect , to humor , to the club scene , to everything .
it is all part of his grandiose sense of self esteem , which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with kurt , and all kinds of other things .
with pellit , seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible .
farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character , suggesting the comb over hairstyle , pot belly and an affinity for chinese dragons .
kevin spacey as david harken
president of comnidyne industries .
tom cruise , philip seymour hoffman and jeff bridges had been approached by new line cinema to take the role , described as a psychopathic master manipulator with an attractive wife .
spacey signed up for the role in june CD .
the part was considered integral to the film .
gordon commented that the character was an amalgamation of several real bosses rather than CD single person to avoid being sued .
jamie foxx as dean motherfuckah jones
the character had the more colorful name cocksucker jones , but it was changed at foxx 's request , with producer jay stern commenting that foxx felt it was over the line .
the current name was said to be subject to further change , prior to the release of the film .
foxx contributed to his character 's appearance , suggesting full scalp tattoos and a retro clothing style .
foxx described the appearance as a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he is living in his own time capsule .
when he got out he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in .
during the CD year development of the film , several actors were in negotiations to star , including owen wilson , vince vaughn , matthew mcconaughey , ryan reynolds , dax shepard , and johnny knoxville .
donald sutherland portrays jack pellitt , bobby 's father and kurt 's boss .
on july CD , CD , isaiah mustafa was confirmed as joining the cast .
mustafa was quoted as saying it is a smaller role .
he appears as officer wilkens .
julie bowen appears in the film as rhonda , harken 's wife .
bowen stated that her character may or may not be a hussy , the character described as intentionally making her husband jealous .
ioan gruffudd has a cameo as a male prostitute erroneously hired as a hitman .
lindsay sloane appears as dale 's fiancee stacy .
p. j. byrne plays kenny sommerfeld , a former investment manager , now scrounging for drinks , while wendell pierce and ron white play a pair of cops .
bob newhart makes a cameo as sadistic comnidyne ceo louis sherman .
john francis daley , a screenwriter on the film , cameos as nick 's co worker carter .
markowitz 's script for horrible bosses was sold at auction to new line cinema by ratner 's production company rat entertainment in CD for a CD figure amount .
ratner initially was interested in directing , but became occupied with directing the comedy tower heist .
frank oz and david dobkin were in talks to direct .
jonathan goldstein and john francis daley rewrote the script in CD , and the project went into production with seth gordon directing .
production designer shepherd frankel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the CD employees and their respective bosses homes and offices .
nick and harken 's workplace is the comnidyne bullpen , which was designed to enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office .
the design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office .
costume designer carol ramsey worked with frankel and set decorator jan pascale to match harken 's suit to that of the surrounding cold grey and blue color palette of his office .
harken 's home was described as equally lacking in warmth as the office but more lavishly decorated and for show , including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his trophy wife .
designing julia 's office was described as a challenge , infusing a sensual vibe into a dental office .
it is highly designed , with rich wallpaper and tones , sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting all very disarming till you step into her private office .
the blinds close , the door locks and you think , it is the temple of doom .
similarly approaching the character 's home , the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she could not get away with at work .
bobby 's environments were designed with more contrast , the character being new to the work area .
frankel described the contrast as the company reflects jack pellitt 's human touch , whereas bobby pellitt 's home is a shameless shrine to himself and his hedonistic appetites .
frankel continued , it features a mishmash of anything he finds exotic and erotic , mostly egyptian and asian motifs with an 80s studio CD vibe , a makeshift dojo , lots of mirrors and a massage table .
some parts of the house design were provided by farrell and gordon 's interpretation of the character and his infatuation with martial arts and his delusions of prowess .
filming of horrible bosses took place in and around los angeles .
comnidyine was represented by an office building in torrance , california , with the crew building the set on a vacant floor .
for pellitt chemical , the production team found a perfect landscape of pipes and containers in santa fe springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility .
to take advantage of the surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls , including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of sutherland 's character .
a t.g.i. friday 's in woodland hills , los angeles , was used as a bar frequented by nick , dale , and kurt , while the bar scene where they meet with jones was staged in downtown los angeles .
the film was shot digitally using the panavision genesis camera .
gordon encouraged the actors to improvise , though aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co stars , stating , my dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn t much that i needed to do .
the soundtrack was composed by award winning composer christopher lennertz , with music contributed by mike mccready of pearl jam , stefan lessard of dave matthews band and money mark a collaborator with the beastie boys .
mccready , lessard , and mark worked with musicians matt chamberlain , david levita , aaron kaplan , victor indrizzo , chris chaney , davey chegwidden and dj cheapshot to develop the music .
major contributions were provided by mark on keyboard , mccready and levita on guitar , chaney and lessard on bass , indrizzo on drums and dj cheapshot on turntables .
lennertz recorded the soundtrack at the village recording studio in west los angeles and capitol records .
lennertz attempted to remain authentic to the characters progression from average worker to calculated killer .
to achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks on CD inch analog tape , intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record .
he explained , the idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album .
it is not over produced or shiny and digital in any way .
it is brash , noisy , and full of bravado and swagger .
i knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score , then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against bateman , sudeikis , and charlie day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire .
lennertz continued , we tracked through tape before pro tools to get that fat sound , and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection .
we even used the same wurlitzer that money mark played on beck 's classic where it is at .
at the end of the day , seth gordon and i wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself .
i think we did it and most of all , everyone had a blast in the process .

the CD rajneeshee assassination plot was a conspiracy by a group of high ranking followers of bhagwan shree rajneesh later known as osho to assassinate charles turner , the then united states attorney for the district of oregon .
rajneesh 's personal secretary and second in command , ma anand sheela sheela silverman , assembled the group after turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at rajneeshpuram .
turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and sham marriages , and later headed the federal prosecution of the CD rajneeshee bioterror attack in the dalles , oregon .
the conspirators included ma anand sheela , sally anne croft , chief financial officer of rajneeshpuram .
susan hagan , head of security at rajneeshpuram , catherine jane stork , who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered to be the actual murderer .
ann phyllis mccarthy , fourth in command of rajneeshpuram .
and co conspirators alma potter , carol matthews , phyllis caldwell and richard kevin langford .
the conspirators obtained false identification to purchase handguns out of state , stalked turner , and planned to murder him near his workplace in portland , oregon .
the assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later , as a result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the bioterror attack in the dalles and other illegal acts by the rajneeshpuram leadership .
prosecution of the conspirators began in CD , when a federal grand jury brought indictments against several of the key players .
some had fled the country , and extradition proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for CD years .
the final conspirator was convicted in CD , when catherine jane stork agreed to return to the united states from germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in australia .
CD perpetrators received sentences ranging from CD years probation to CD years in federal prison and an additional member of the rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy .
rajneesh was never prosecuted in relation to the conspiracy , and left the united states after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to reenter the country without permission from the you.s. attorney general .
CD followers called rajneeshees of charismatic leader bhagwan shree rajneesh now known as osho , were convicted of a CD conspiracy to assassinate charles turner , and an additional unindicted eighth member of the rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy .
the perpetrators were high ranking followers within the rajneeshee organization .
prosecutors in the case stated that the perpetrators had planned to murder turner after he was appointed to head an investigation into the group 's activities in rajneeshpuram , oregon .
turner 's investigation focused on sham marriages organized by the group , as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud , and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the CD rajneeshee bioterror attack in the dalles , oregon .
oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group , working alongside turner .
in may CD , rajneesh 's personal secretary and second in command , sheela silverman ma anand sheela , gathered the leader 's key followers and formed a group of conspirators in order to plan the assassination of turner , as well as several dissidents among their organization .
sheela stated that turner 's grand jury investigation threatened the existence of the commune , and exposed rajneesh and several of his disciples to criminal prosecution .
sheela hoped that by murdering turner they would be able to thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have resulted in deportation of rajneeshee leaders .
susan hagan ma anand su , a top official in the rajneeshpuram hierarchy , was also a participant in the assassination conspiracy .
hagan was in charge of the security force at rajneeshpuram , ran the rajneesh investment corporation , and supervised construction on the commune .
other conspirators in the assassination plot included ann phyllis mccarthy ma yoga vidya , president of the rajneesh commune , and alma potter ma dhyan yogini , ma anand sheela 's bodyguard and traveling companion .
potter was manager of the hotel rajneesh in portland , oregon , and a member of the commune 's security force .
catherine jane stork volunteered to be the follower who would actually murder turner , and bought guns and silencers .
stork was known to fellow followers as ma shanti bhadra , and was also CD of the CD big mammas in rajneeshpuram .
sally anne croft known by followers as ma prem savita , an accountant and the group 's chief financial officer , provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot .
phyllis caldwell ma deva ritka described in a federal affidavit how members of the murder conspiracy obtained handguns , referring to catherine jane stork and sally anne croft shanti b went down to jesus grove , and savita gave us several CD dollars to use to buy guns .
jesus grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the rajneesh commune resided , except for bhagwan shree rajneesh .
ma anand sheela and CD other rajneesh followers traveled to new york in the spring of CD to acquire false identification .
according to a federal indictment , the perpetrators of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns .
CD members of the group then traveled to texas to purchase handguns .
caldwell stated she and catherine jane stork flew to texas to purchase guns there .
they purchased CD guns in texas , but encountered difficulty purchasing handguns in texas with out of state identification and traveled to new mexico instead .
caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed not to come back without the guns .
in new mexico , they obtained false identification , and purchased several pistols .
their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace .
caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in new mexico we found it was pretty easy to buy guns .
all you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get .
caldwell said she and stork went to a university library to find the identity of someone dying very young , next went to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate and described how we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt .
and then we were able to go to several different gun shops in albuquerque with those CD bits of identification and buy CD different guns and bullets , said caldwell .
they were able to obtain CD colt .38 caliber revolver , and CD ruger CD caliber security six magnum revolvers .
the conspirators smuggled the guns into oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a greyhound lines bus .
caldwell said that she and stork traveled by bus back to the rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors .
after obtaining guns the conspirators returned to portland , oregon .
they rented out an apartment in portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of turner .
rajneesh follower carol matthews ma prem samadhi used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of charles turner .
according to federal prosecutors matthews obtained a college yearbook of turner 's , and learned his car 's license plate number and his parking location .
court records state that matthews and an unindicted co conspirator gave voter registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting a voter survey on president reagan 's economic plan , in order to obtain turner 's route number and post office box number .
the CD tried repeating the story with members of the you.s. postal service , but the postal officials did not give them turner 's address .
they then drove around turner 's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said turner .
matthews had pictures of turner 's residence developed .
these were later obtained by the federal bureau of investigation fbi during an investigation of the rajneesh commune , and verified after being shown to turner .
members of the group of conspirators watched turner 's office , home and car , and discussed methods to assassinate him , hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into rajneeshpuram .
their plan was to shoot turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked , in portland , oregon , but the conspirators also debated whether to murder turner in downtown portland or closer to his home .
after spending multiple nights watching turner 's house , the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work , or in front of his home .
turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath terry schrunk plaza in portland , oregon .
in an affidavit given to the fbi , conspirator alma peralta described how the perpetrators decided on the federal parking garage as the location shanti bhadra catherine jane stork said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off .
the conspirators practiced different ways of murdering turner .
according to informant statements to law enforcement , CD of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble , and the others would then approach turner with their guns .
informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of rajneesh communes if the plan was successful .
according to the oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because ma anand sheela became distracted by political power plays within the rajneesh commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group .
on february CD , CD , congressman james h. weaver gave a speech in the united states house of representatives in which he asserted that the rajneeshees were involved in the bioterror attack in oregon .

the charges were first detailed at an october CD bond hearing in north carolina after rajneesh and his followers were arrested at an airport in charlotte .
weaver said in court that followers of bhagwan shree rajneesh had plotted to assassinate turner and frohnmayer .
he said these allegations were reasons why releasing rajneesh and his followers from jail would be a clear and present danger to public officials .

the lake was searched by you.s. navy divers .
scuba divers searched the lake for CD days but did not find the guns .

greene said that members involved in the assassination plot included ma anand sheela , dianne yvonne onang , and alma peralta .
the assassination plot was investigated by the fbi and the oregon state police .
informants told law enforcement that ma anand sheela hoped turner 's death would prevent an immigration and naturalization service investigation which she thought could lead to rajneesh 's arrest and deportation from the united states .

there were not simply plans , but at least CD assassination attempt , said weaver at the hearing .

of the action sequences , he said , die another day is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects .
the cgi work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything i have seen in a major motion picture .
coupled with lousy production design , die another day looks like it was done on the cheap .

invisible cars and dodgy cgi footage
please

so , instead of bowing to this altar , they have said , okay , we have this family that is half black , half white , half american , half british .
we have a mix of boys and girls , CD character who is mixed raced and deaf but we are not going to be restrained by any of that .

and then holby came along , so i am very grateful .

i really love holby and i am surprised how much .
what thrills me about holby is that you get back what you put in .
the powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job .
for me it is about more than turning up and saying the lines .
it is about understanding it and trying to make it better .
that is actually a lot of fun .
what is great is nobody says , just shut up .
they want you to work at it .
i surprise myself sometimes because after CD and a half years sometimes i see friends on the side of a poster and i think , do i want to do something else
