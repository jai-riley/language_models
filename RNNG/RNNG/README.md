# Recurrent Neural Network Grammar (RNNG)

The code in [rnng-pytorch](rnng-pytorch) is based on the work of Noji & Oseki (2021):

> [Effective Batching for Recurrent Neural Network Grammars](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.380.pdf) <br>
> Hiroshi Noji and Yohei Oseki <br>
> Findings of ACL - ACL-IJCNLP 2021 <br>


I made minor changes to the code, such as:
* Increasing the reporting of training and validation loss

The following files are my own work:
