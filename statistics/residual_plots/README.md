When comparing the base models to the models with surprisals added, very little is noticeably different.

Q-Q plots: For all languages, the deviance residuals are touching the slope within theoretical 
quantiles range [-0.75, 0.5] with slight deviations at these points. 

Histogram: For all languages, the histograms are mostly best shaped with a very slight left skewing.

Residuals vs linear predictor scatterplot: All languages fall within the normal distribution with 
Korean having the most outliers out of the [-1,1] range.

Observed vs fitted values: Similar to above
